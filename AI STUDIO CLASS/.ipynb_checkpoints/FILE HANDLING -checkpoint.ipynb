      "The Railroad Station  \n",
      "They got off the Oimachi train at Jiyugaoka Station, and Mother t ook Totto-chan by \n",
      "the hand to lead her through the ticket gate. She had hardly ever be en on a train \n",
      "before and was reluctant to give up the precious ticket she was clut ching. \n",
      "“May 1 keep it!” Totto-chan asked the ticket collector. \n",
      "“No, you can't,” he replied, taking it from her. \n",
      "She pointed to his box filled with tickets. \"Are those all yours! \" \n",
      "“No, they belong to the railroad station,” he replied, as he snatc hed away tickets from \n",
      "people going out. \n",
      "“Oh.” Totto-chan gazed longingly into the box and went on, “When I grow  up I'm \n",
      "going to sell railroad tickets!” \n",
      "The ticket collector glanced at her for the first time. “My little boy wants a job in the \n",
      "station, too, so you can work together.” \n",
      "Totto-chan stepped to one side and took a good look at the ticket collector.  He was \n",
      "plump and wore glasses and seemed rather kind. \n",
      "“Hmm.” She put her hands on her hips and carefully considered the idea.  \"I wouldn't \n",
      "mind at all working with your son,” she said. “I’ll think it over. But I'm rather busy \n",
      "just now as I'm on my way to a new school.\" \n",
      "She ran to where Mother waited, shouting, “I’m going to be a ticke t seller!” \n",
      "Mother wasn't surprised, but she said, “I thought you were going t o be a spy.” \n",
      "As Totto-chan began walking along holding Mother's hand, she remembered that \n",
      "until the day before she had been quite sure she wanted to be a spy. \n",
      "But what fun it would be to be in charge of a box full of tickets! \n",
      " 2 “That's it!” A splendid idea occurred to her. She looked up at Mother  and informed \n",
      "her of it at the top of her voice, “Couldn't I be a ticket seller who's really a spy!” \n",
      "Mother didn't reply. Under her felt hat with its little flower s, her lovely face was \n",
      "serious. The fact was Mother was very worried. What if they wouldn't have Totto-\n",
      "chan at the new school! She looked at Totto-chan skipping along the road chattering \n",
      "to herself. Totto-chan didn't know Mother was worried, so when their  eyes met, she \n",
      "said gaily, “I've changed my mind. I think I'll join one of those l ittle bands of street \n",
      "musicians who go about advertising new stores!” \n",
      "There was a touch of despair in Mother's voice as she said, “Come  on, we'll be late. \n",
      "We mustn't keep the headmaster waiting. No more chatter. Look whe re you're going \n",
      "and walk properly.” \n",
      "Ahead of them, in the distance, the gate of a small school was gr adually coming into \n",
      "view. \n",
      "The Little Girl at the Window \n",
      "The reason Mother was worried was because although Totto-chan had only  just \n",
      "started school, she had already been expelled. Fancy being expe lled from the first \n",
      "grade! \n",
      "It  had  happened  only  a week  ago.  Mother  had been sent for by Totto-chan's \n",
      "homeroom teacher, who came straight to the point. \"Your daughter di srupts my \n",
      "whole class. I must ask you to take her to another school.” The prett y young teacher \n",
      "sighed. “I'm really at the end of my tether.” \n",
      "Mother was completely taken aback. What on earth did Totto-chan do to disrupt the \n",
      "whole class, she wondered! \n",
      "Blinking nervously and touching her hair, cut in a short pageboy style, the teacher \n",
      "started to explain. “Well, to begin with, she opens and shuts her des k hundreds of \n",
      "times. I've said that no one is to open or shut their desk unless they have to take \n",
      "something out or put something away. So your daughter is constantly ta king \n",
      "something out and putting something away - taking out or putting away h er \n",
      "notebook, her pencil box, her textbooks, and everything else in her desk. F or \n",
      "instance, say we are going to write the alphabet, your daughter opens her desk, takes \n",
      "out her notebook, and bangs the top down. Then she opens her desk again, puts her \n",
      "head inside, gets our a pencil, quickly shuts the desk, and writes a n 'A.' If she's \n",
      "written it badly or made a mistake she opens the desk again, get s out an eraser, shuts \n",
      "the desk, erases the letter, then opens and shuts the desk again to put  away the eraser-\n",
      "-all at top speed. When she's written the 'A' over again, she puts  every single item \n",
      "back into the desk, one by one. She puts away the pencil, shuts the desk,  then opens \n",
      "it again to put away the notebook. Then, when she gets to the next l etter, she goes \n",
      "through it all again--first the note-book, then the pencil, then the eraser--opening and \n",
      "shutting her desk every single time. It makes my head spin. And I can't scold her \n",
      "because she opens and shuts it each time for a reason.” \n",
      "The teacher's long eyelashes fluttered even more as if she were reliving the scene in \n",
      "her mind. \n",
      " 3 It suddenly dawned on Mother why Totto-chan opened and shut her desk so often.  \n",
      "She remembered how excited Totto-chan had been when she came home from  her \n",
      "first day at school. She had said, “School's wonderful! My desk at home has drawers \n",
      "you pull out, but the one at school has a top you lift up. It's like a box , and you can \n",
      "keep all sorts of things inside. It's super!” \n",
      "Mother pictured her delightedly opening and shutting the lid of this new desk. And \n",
      "Mother didn't think it was all that naughty either. Anyway, Totto -chan would \n",
      "probably stop doing it as soon as the novelty wore off. But all she sa id to the teacher \n",
      "was, “I'll speak to her about it.” \n",
      "The teacher's voice rose in pitch as she continued, “I wouldn't mind if that was all.\" \n",
      "Mother flinched as the teacher leaned forward. \n",
      "“When she's not making a clatter with her desk, she's standing up.  All through class!” \n",
      "“Standing up! Where?” asked Mother, surprised. \n",
      "“At the window,” the teacher replied crossly. \n",
      "“Why does she stand at the window?” Mother asked, puzzled. \n",
      "“So she can invite the street musicians over!” she almost shrieke d. \n",
      "The gist of the teacher's story was that after an hour of al most constantly banging her \n",
      "desk top, Totto-chan would leave her desk and stand by the window, looking out.  \n",
      "Then, just as the teacher was beginning to think that as long as s he was quiet she \n",
      "might just as well stay there, Totto-chan would suddenly call out to a passing band of \n",
      "garishly dressed street musicians. To Totto-chan's delight and the teacher's \n",
      "tribulation, the classroom was on the ground floor looking out on the street . There \n",
      "was only a low hedge in between, so anyone in the classroom could eas ily talk to \n",
      "people going by. When Totto-chan called to them, the street musici ans would come \n",
      "right over to the window. Whereupon, said the teacher, Totto-chan would a nnounce \n",
      "the fact to the whole room, \"Here they are!\" and all the childr en would crowd by the \n",
      "window and call out to the musicians. \n",
      "\"Play something,\" Totto-chan would say, and the little band, which usual ly passed \n",
      "the school quietly, would put on a rousing performance for the pupils w ith their \n",
      "clarinet, gongs, drums, and samisen, while the poor teacher could do little but wait \n",
      "patiently for the din to stop. \n",
      "Finally, when the music finished, the musicians would leave and the s tudents would \n",
      "go back to their seats. All except Totto-chan. When the teacher asked, \"Why are you \n",
      "still at the window?\" Totto-chan replied, quite seriously, \"Another band might come \n",
      "by. And, anyway, it would be such a shame if the others came ba ck and we missed \n",
      "them.\" \n",
      "\"You can see how disruptive all this is, can't you?\" said the tea cher emotionally. \n",
      "Mother was beginning to sympathize with her when she began again i n an even \n",
      "shriller voice, \"And then, besides... \n",
      " 4 \"What else does she do?\" asked Mother, with a sinking feeling. \n",
      "\"What else?\" exclaimed the teacher. “If I could even count the things she does I \n",
      "wouldn't be asking you to take her away.” \n",
      "The teacher composed herself a little, and looked straight at Mot her. \"Yesterday, \n",
      "Totto-chan was standing at the window as usual, and I went on with the  lesson \n",
      "thinking she was just waiting for the street musicians, when she suddenly called out \n",
      "to somebody, 'What are you doing!' From where I was I couldn't see  who she was \n",
      "taking to, and I wondered what was going on. Then she called out agai n, 'What are \n",
      "you doing!' She wasn't addressing anyone in the road but somebody high u p \n",
      "somewhere. I couldn't help being curious, and tried to hear the reply , but there wasn't \n",
      "any. In spite of that, your daughter kept on calling out, 'What are y ou doing?' so often \n",
      "I couldn't teach, so I went over to the window to see who your daught er was talking \n",
      "to. When I put my head out of the window and looked up, I saw it was a  pair of \n",
      "swallows making a nest under the classroom eaves. She was talki ng to the swallows! \n",
      "Now, I understand children, and so I'm not saying that talking to swa llows is \n",
      "nonsense. It is just that I feel it is quite unnecessary to ask swallows what they are \n",
      "doing in the middle of class.\" \n",
      "Before Mother could open her mouth to apologize, the teacher went on, “T hen there \n",
      "was the drawing class episode. I asked the children to draw the J apanese flag, and all \n",
      "the others drew it correctly but your daughter started drawing t he navy flag - you \n",
      "know the one with the rays. Nothing wrong with that, I thought. But then she \n",
      "suddenly started to draw a fringe all around it. A fringe! You know,  like those fringes \n",
      "on youth group banners. She's probably seen one somewhere. But before I realized \n",
      "what she was doing, she had drawn a yellow fringe that went right off the edge of the \n",
      "paper and onto her desk. You see, her flag took up most of the paper, so there wasn't \n",
      "enough room for the fringe. She took her yellow crayon and all around her flag she \n",
      "made hundreds of strokes that extended beyond the paper, so that when she  lifted up \n",
      "the paper her desk was a mass of dreadful yellow marks that wouldn't  come off no \n",
      "matter how hard we rubbed. Fortunately, the lines were only on-t hree sides.\" \n",
      "Puzzled, Mother asked quickly, \"What do you mean, only three sides!\" \n",
      "Although she seemed to be getting tired, the teacher was kind enoug h to explain. \n",
      "\"She drew a flagpole on the left, so the fringe was only on three sides of the flag.\" \n",
      "Mother felt somewhat relieved. \"I see, only on three sides.\" \n",
      "Whereupon the teacher said very slowly, emphasizing each word, “But most of the \n",
      "flagpole went off the paper, too, and is still on the desk as well .\" \n",
      "Then the teacher got up and said coldly, as a sort of parting shot,  \"I’m not the only \n",
      "one who is upset. The teacher in the classroom next door has also had trouble.\" \n",
      "Mother obviously had to do something about it. It wasn't fair to the othe r pupils. \n",
      "She'd have to find another school, a school where they would understand her  little \n",
      "girl and teach her how to get along with other people. \n",
      " 5 The school they were on their way to was one Mother had found after a  good deal of \n",
      "searching.  \n",
      "Mother did not tell Totto-chan she had been expelled. She realized Tot to-chan \n",
      "wouldn't understand what she had done wrong and she didn't want her to get an y \n",
      "complexes, so she decided not to tell Totto-chan until she was grown- up. All Mother \n",
      "said was, “How would you like to go to a new school! I've heard of a very nice one.” \n",
      "\"All right,\" said Totto-chan, after thinking it over. \n",
      "“But...” \n",
      "\"What is it now?\" thought Mother. “Does she realize she's been e xpelled?” \n",
      "But a moment later Totto-chan was asking joyfully, \"Do you think the street \n",
      "musicians will come to the new school?\" \n",
      "The New School \n",
      "When she saw the gate of the new school, Totto-chan stopped. The gate of the school \n",
      "she used to go to had fine concrete pillars with the name of the sc hool in large \n",
      "characters. But the gate of this new school simply consisted of two rather short posts \n",
      "that still had twigs and leaves on them. \n",
      "\"This gate's growing,\" said Totto-chan. \"It'll probably go on grow ing till it's taller \n",
      "than the telephone poles!\" \n",
      "The two \"gateposts\" were clearly trees with roots. When she got  closer, she had to \n",
      "put her head to one side to read the name of the school because the wi nd had blown \n",
      "the sign askew. \n",
      "\"To-mo-e Ga-ku-en.\" \n",
      "Totto-chan was about to ask Mother what “Tomoe” meant, when she caught  a \n",
      "glimpse of something that made her think she must be dreaming. She  squatted down \n",
      "and peered through the shrubbery to get a better look, and she couldn't be lieve her \n",
      "eyes. \n",
      "\"Mother, is that really a train! There, in the school grounds!\" \n",
      "For its classrooms, the school had made use of six abandoned railroad c ars. To Totto-\n",
      "chan it seemed something you might dream about. A school in a train!  \n",
      "The windows of the railroad cars sparkled in the morning sunlight. But  the eyes of \n",
      "the rosy-cheeked little  girl  gazing at  them  through  the  shr ubbery sparkled even \n",
      "more. \n",
      "“I Like This School!”  \n",
      "A moment later, Totto-chan let out a whoop of joy and started running  toward the \n",
      "\"train school,\" calling out to Mother over her shoulder, \"Come on, hurr y, let's get on \n",
      "this train that's standing still.\" \n",
      " 6 Startled, Mother began to run after her. Mother had been on a baske tball team once, \n",
      "so she was faster than Totto-chan and caught hold of her dress just as she reached a \n",
      "door. \n",
      "“You can't go in yet,” said Mother, holding her back. “The cars ar e classrooms, and \n",
      "you haven't even been accepted here yet. If you really want to get on this train, you'll \n",
      "have to be nice and polite to the headmaster. We're going to call on him now, and if \n",
      "all goes well, you'll be able to go to this school. Do you understa nd?” \n",
      "Totto-chan was awfully disappointed not to get on the \"train\" right a way, but she \n",
      "decided she had better do as Mother told her. \n",
      "\"All right,\" she said. And then added, \"I like this school a lot. \" \n",
      "Mother felt like telling her it wasn't a matter of whethe r she liked the school but of \n",
      "whether the headmaster liked her. But she just let go of Totto-cha n's dress, took hold \n",
      "of her hand, and started walking toward the headmaster's office. \n",
      "All the railroad cars were quiet, for the first classes of the day had begun. Instead of a \n",
      "wall, the not very spacious school grounds were surrounded by trees, and there were \n",
      "flower beds full of red and yellow flowers. \n",
      "The headmaster's office wasn't in a railroad car, but was on the right-hand side of a \n",
      "one-story building that stood at the top of a semicircular flight of about seven stone \n",
      "steps opposite the gate. \n",
      "Totto-chan let go of Mother's hand and raced up the steps, then turned aro und \n",
      "abruptly, almost causing Mother to run into her. \n",
      "\"What's the matter?\" Mother asked, fearing Totto-chan might ha ve changed her mind \n",
      "about the school. \n",
      "Standing above her on the top step, Totto-chan whispered to Mother in all  \n",
      "seriousness, \"The man we're going to see must be a stationmas ter!\" \n",
      "Mother had plenty of patience as well as a great sense of fun. She  put her face close \n",
      "to Totto-chan's and whispered, “Why?” \n",
      "Totto-chan whispered back, \"You said he was the headmaster, but if he  owns all \n",
      "these trains, he must be a stationmaster.\" \n",
      "Mother had to admit it was unusual for a school to make use of old rail road cars, but \n",
      "there was no time to explain. She simply said, \"Why don't you as k him yourself! \n",
      "And, anyway, what about Daddy? He plays the violin and owns severa l violins, but \n",
      "that doesn't make our house a violin shop, does it?\" \n",
      "\"No, it doesn't,\" Totto-chan agreed, catching hold of Mother's hand. \n",
      "The Headmaster \n",
      "When Mother and Totto-chan went in, the man in the office got up from his  chair. \n",
      " 7 His hair was thin on top and he had a few teeth missing, but his fac e was a healthy \n",
      "color. Although he wasn't very tall, he had solid shoulders and arms and was neatly \n",
      "dressed in a rather shabby black three-piece suit. \n",
      "With a hasty bow, Totto-chan asked him spiritedly \"What are you, a schoolmaster or \n",
      "a stationmaster?\" \n",
      "Mother was embarrassed, but before she had time to explain, he laughed and replied, \n",
      "\"I'm the head-master of this school.\" \n",
      "Totto-chan was delighted. \"Oh, I'm so glad,\" she said, “because I  want to ask you a \n",
      "favor. I'd like to come to your school.” \n",
      "The headmaster offered her a chair and turned to Mother. \"You may go home now. I \n",
      "want to talk to Totto-chan.\" \n",
      "Totto-chan had a moment's uneasiness, but somehow felt she would get a long all \n",
      "right with this man. \"Well, then, I’ll leave her with you,\" Mother said bravely, and \n",
      "shut the door behind her as she went out. \n",
      "The headmaster drew over a chair and put it facing Totto-chan,  and when they were \n",
      "both sitting down close together, he said, \"Now then, tell me al l about yourself. Tell \n",
      "me anything at all you want to talk about.\" \n",
      "\"Anything I like?\" Totto-chan had expected him to ask questions she w ould have to \n",
      "answer. When he said she could talk about anything she wanted, she was  so happy \n",
      "she began straight away. It was all a bit higgledy-piggledy, but  she talked for all she \n",
      "was worth. She told the headmaster how fast the train went that  they had come on; \n",
      "how she had asked the ticket collector but he wouldn't let her keep her ticket; how \n",
      "pretty her homeroom teacher was at the other school; about the sw allows' nest; about \n",
      "their brown dog, Rocky, who could do all sorts of tricks; how she used t o go snip-\n",
      "snip with the scissors inside her mouth at kindergarten and the teacher  said she \n",
      "mustn't do that because she might cut her tongue off, but she did it a nyway; how she \n",
      "always blew her nose because Mother scolded her if it was runn y; what a good \n",
      "swimmer Daddy was, and how he could dive as well. She went on and on.  The \n",
      "headmaster would laugh, nod, and say, \"And then?\" And Totto-chan was s o happy \n",
      "she kept right on talking. But finally she ran out of things to say. She sat with her \n",
      "mouth closed trying hard to think of something. \n",
      "\"Haven't you anything more you can tell me?\" asked the headmast er. \n",
      "What a shame to stop now, Totto-chan thought. It was such a wonderful chance. \n",
      "Wasn't there anything else she could talk about, she wondered, racki ng her brains? \n",
      "Then she had an idea. \n",
      "She could tell him about the dress she was wearing that day. Mothe r made most of \n",
      "her dresses, but this one came from a shop. Her clothes were alw ays torn when she \n",
      "came home in the late afternoon. Some of the rips were quite bad. Mother never \n",
      "knew how they got that way. Even her white cotton panties were somet imes in \n",
      "shreds. She explained to the headmaster that they got torn when she crossed other \n",
      "people's gardens by crawling under their fences, and when she burrowe d under the \n",
      " 8 barbed wire around vacant lots. So this morning, she said, when she wa s getting \n",
      "dressed to come here, all the nice dresses Mother had made wer e torn so she had to \n",
      "wear one Mother had bought. It had small dark red and gray checks a nd was made of \n",
      "jersey, and it wasn't bad, but Mother thought the red flowers embroide red on the \n",
      "collar were in bad taste. \"Mother doesn't like the collar,\" sa id Totto-chan, holding it \n",
      "up for the headmaster to see. \n",
      "After that, she could think of nothing more to say no matter how hard sh e tried. It \n",
      "made her rather sad. But just then the headmaster got up, placed his  large, warm \n",
      "hand on her head, and said, \"Well, now you're a pupil of this school.\" \n",
      "Those were his very words. And at that moment Totto-chan felt she had met \n",
      "someone she really liked for the very first time in her life. You see, up till then, no \n",
      "one had ever listened to her for so long. And all that time the hea dmaster hadn't \n",
      "yawned once or looked bored, but seemed just as interested in what she had to say as \n",
      "she was. \n",
      "Totto-chan hadn't learned how to tell time yet, but it did seem l ike a rather long time. \n",
      "If she had been able to, she would have been astonished, and even more g rateful to \n",
      "the headmaster. For, you see, Mother and Totto-chan arrived at the school at eight, \n",
      "and when she had finished talking and the headmaster had told her she wa s a pupil of \n",
      "the school, he looked at his pocket watch and said, \"Ah, it's time f or lunch.\" So the \n",
      "headmaster must have listened to Totto-chan for four solid hours! \n",
      "Neither before nor since did any grown-up listen to Totto-chan for as long as that. \n",
      "And, besides, it would have amazed Mother and her homeroom teacher to t hink that \n",
      "a seven-year-old child could find enough to talk about for four hours nonstop. \n",
      "Totto-chan had no idea then, of course, that she had been expelled and that  people \n",
      "were at their wit's end to know what to do. Having a naturally sunny  disposition and \n",
      "being a bit absent-minded gave her an air of innocence. But deep down s he felt she \n",
      "was considered different from other children and slightly strange.  The headmaster, \n",
      "however, made her feel safe and warm and happy. She wanted to sta y with him \n",
      "forever. \n",
      "That's how Totto-chan felt about Headmaster Sosaku Kobayashi that fir st day. And, \n",
      "luckily, the head-master felt the same about her. \n",
      "Lunchtime \n",
      "The headmaster took Totto-chan to see where the children had lunch. \"We don't have \n",
      "lunch in the train,\" he explained, \"but in the Assembly Hall.\" The  Assembly Hall was \n",
      "at the top of the stone steps Totto-chan had come up earlier. When they  got there, \n",
      "they found the children noisily moving desks and chairs about, arrangi ng them in a \n",
      "circle. As they stood in one corner and watched, Totto-chan tugged at t he \n",
      "headmaster's jacket and asked, \"Where are the rest of the childr en?\" \n",
      "\"This is all there are,\" he replied. \n",
      "\"All there are?\" Totto-chan couldn't believe it. \n",
      "There were as many children as this in just one grade at the ot her school. \n",
      " 9 \"You mean there are only about fifty children in the whole school?\" \n",
      "\"That's all,\" said the headmaster. \n",
      "Everything about this school was different from the other one, thought T otto-chan. \n",
      "When everyone was seated, the headmaster asked the pupils if they  had all brought \n",
      "something from the ocean and something from the hills. \n",
      "\"Yes!\" they chorused, opening their various lunch-boxes. \n",
      "\"Let's see what you've got,\" said the headmaster, strolling  about in the circle of desks \n",
      "and looking into each box while the children squealed with delight. \n",
      "\"How funny,\" thought Totto-chan. “I wonder what he means by 'something from the \n",
      "ocean and something from the hills.'” This school was different. It  was fun. She \n",
      "never thought lunch at school could be as much fun as this. The thought that  \n",
      "tomorrow she would be sitting at one of those desks, showing the headmas ter her \n",
      "lunch with \"something from the ocean and something from the hills\" made  Totto-\n",
      "chan so happy she wanted to jump for joy. \n",
      "As he inspected the lunchboxes, the headmaster's shoulders were bathe d in the soft \n",
      "noontime light. \n",
      "Totto-chan Starts School \n",
      "After the headmaster had said, \"Now you're a pupil of this school ,\" Totto-chan could \n",
      "hardly wait for the next day to dawn. She had never looked forward t o a day so \n",
      "much. Mother usually had trouble getting Totto-chan out of bed in the morning , but \n",
      "that day she was up before anyone else, all dressed and waiti ng with her schoolbag \n",
      "snapped to her back. \n",

      "Totto-chan's unusual behavior with suspicion, but after a good stretch, h e positioned \n",
      "himself close to her, expecting something to happen. \n",
      "Mother had a lot to do. She busily made up a box lunch containing \"something from \n",
      "the ocean and something from the hills\" while she gave Totto-chan her breakfast. \n",
      "Mother also put Totto-chan's train pass in a plastic case and hung i t around Totto-\n",

      "\"Be a good girl,\" said Daddy, his hair all tousled. \n",
      "\"Of course.\" Totto-chan put on her shoes and opened the front door, then turned \n",
      "around, bowed politely, and said, “Goodbye, everybody.” \n",
      "Tears welled up in Mother's eyes as she watched Totto-chan go out. It was hard to \n",
      "believe that this vivacious little girl, setting off so obedientl y and happily, had just \n",
      "been expelled from school. She prayed fervently that all would go we ll this time. \n",
      " 10  A moment later Mother was startled to see Totto-chan remove the  train pass and \n",
      "hang it around Rocky's neck instead. \"Oh dear ... \" thought Mother, but  she decided \n",
      "to say nothing but wait and see what happened. \n",
      "After Totto-chan put the cord with the pass around Rocky's neck, she squatted down \n",
      "and said to him, \"You see? This pass doesn't fit you at all.\" \n",
      "The cord was much too long and the pass dragged on the ground. \n",
      "\"Do you understand? This is my pass, not yours. You won’t be able to ge t on the \n",
      "train. I'll ask the headmaster, though, and the man at the station,  and see if they’ll let \n",
      "you come to school, too.” \n",
      "Rocky listened attentively at first, ears pointed, but after giving the pass a few licks, \n",
      "he yawned. Totto-chan went on, \"The classroom train doesn't move, so I  don't think \n",
      "you'll need a ticket to get on that one, but today you'll just have to stay home and \n",
      "wait for me.” \n",
      "Rocky always used to walk with Totto-chan as far as the gate of the other school and \n",
      "then come back home. Naturally, he was expecting to do the same t oday. \n",
      "Totto-chan took the cord with the pass off Rocky's neck and carefully hun g it around \n",
      "her own. She called out once more to Mother and Daddy, \"Good-bye!\" \n",
      "Then she ran off, without a backward glance, her bag flapping aga inst her back. \n",
      "Rocky bounded along happily beside her. \n",
      "The way to the station was almost the same as to the old school, so Totto-chan \n",
      "passed dogs and cats she knew, as well as children from her for mer class. \n",
      "Should she show them her pass and impress them, Totto-chan wondered? But s he \n",
      "didn't want to be late, so she decided not to that day, and hurried on. \n",
      "When Totto-chan turned right at the station instead of left as usual,  poor Rocky \n",
      "stopped and looked around anxiously. Totto-chan was already at the tic ket gate, but \n",
      "she went back to Rocky, who stood, looking mystified. \n",
      "\"I’m not going to the other school any more. I'm going to a new one now .” \n",
      "Totto-chan put her face against Rocky's. His ears were smell y, as usual, but to Totto-\n",
      "chan it was a nice smell. \n",
      "\"Bye-bye,\" she said and, showing the man her pass, she starte d climbing up the steep \n",

      "The Classroom in the Train \n",
      "No one had arrived yet when Totto-chan got to the door of the railroad ca r the \n",
      "headmaster had told her would be her classroom. It was an old-fashi oned car, one \n",
      "that still had a door handle on the outside. You took hold of the handle with both \n",
      " 11  hands and slid the door to the right. Totto-chan's heart was beatin g fast with \n",
      "excitement as she peeped inside. \n",
      "\"Ooh!\" \n",
      "Studying here would be like going on a perpetual journey. The window s still had \n",
      "baggage racks above them. The only difference was that there was a  blackboard at \n",
      "the front of the car, and the lengthwise seats had been replaced by school desks and \n",
      "chairs all facing forward. The hand straps had gone, too, but ever ything else had been \n",
      "left just as it was. Totto-chan went in and sat down at someone's  desk. The wooden \n",
      "chairs resembled those at the other school, but they were so much mo re comfortable \n",
      "she could sit on them all day. Totto-chan was so happy and liked the s chool so much, \n",
      "she made a firm decision to come to school every day and never take  any holidays. \n",
      "Totto-chan looked out of the window. She knew the train was stationary, but--was it \n",
      "because the flowers and trees in the school grounds were swaying  slightly in the \n",
      "breeze!--it seemed to be moving. \n",
      "\"I'm so happy!\" she finally said out loud. Then she pressed her fac e against the \n",
      "window and made up a song just as she always did whenever she was happy . \n",
      "I'm so happy, \n",
      "So happy am I! \n",
      "Why am I happy! \n",
      "Because ... \n",
      "Just at that moment someone got on. It was a girl. She took her not ebook and pencil \n",
      "box out of her schoolbag and put them on her desk. Then she stood on tiptoe and put \n",
      "the bag on the rack. She put her shoe bag up there, too. Totto-chan stopped singing \n",
      "and quickly did the same. After that a boy got on. He stood at the door  and threw his \n",
      "bag on the baggage rack as if he were playing basketball. It bounce d off and fell on \n",
      "the floor. \"Bad shot!\" said the boy, taking aim again from the s ame place. This time \n",
      "it stayed on. \"Nice shot!\" he shouted followed by \"No, bad shot,\" as he scrambled \n",
      "onto the desk and opened his bag to get out his notebook and pencil box. His fai lure \n",
      "to do this first evidently made it count as a miss. \n",
      "Eventually there were nine pupils in the car. They comprised the fi rst grade at Tomoe \n",
      "Gakuen. \n",
      "They would all be traveling together on the same train. \n",
      "Lessons at Tomoe \n",
      "Going to school in a railroad car seemed unusual enough, but the seating  \n",
      "arrangements turned our to be unusual, too. At the other school each pupil w as \n",
      "assigned a specific desk. But here they were allowed to sit an ywhere they liked at \n",
      "any time. \n",
      " 12  After a lot of thought and a good look around, Totto-chan decided to sit nex t to the \n",
      "girl who had come after her that morning because the girl was w earing a pinafore \n",
      "with a long-eared rabbit on it. \n",
      "The most unusual thing of all about this school, however, was the less ons \n",
      "themselves. \n",
      "Schools normally schedule one subject, for example, Japanese, the f irst period, when \n",
      "you just do Japanese; then, say, arithmetic the second period, when y ou just do \n",
      "arithmetic. But here it was quite different. At the beginning  of the first period, the \n",
      "teacher made a list of all the problems and questions in the subjec ts to be studied that \n",
      "day. Then she would say, \"Now, start with any of these you like. \" \n",
      "So whether you started on Japanese or arithmetic or something else didn't matter at \n",
      "all. Someone who liked composition might be writing something, while be hind you \n",
      "someone who liked physics might be boiling something in a flask over a n alcohol \n",
      "burner, so that a small explosion was liable to occur in any of the  classrooms. \n",
      "This method of teaching enabled the teachers to observe--as the chi ldren progressed \n",
      "to higher grades --what they were interested in as well as t heir way of thinking and \n",
      "their character. It was an ideal way for teachers to real ly get to know their pupils. \n",
      "As for the pupils, they loved being able to start with their favori te subject, and the \n",
      "fact that they had all day to cope with the subjects they disliked meant they could \n",
      "usually manage them somehow. So study was mostly independent, with pupils free \n",
      "to go and consult the teacher whenever necessary. The teacher w ould come to them, \n",
      "too, if they wanted, and explain any problem until it was thoroughly understood. \n",
      "Then pupils would be given further exercises to work at alone. It was  study in the \n",
      "truest sense of the word, and it meant there were no pupils just s itting inattentively \n",
      "while the teacher talked and explained. \n",
      "The first grade pupils hadn't quite reached the stage of independent  study, but even \n",
      "they were allowed to start with any subject they wanted.  \n",
      "Some copied letters of the alphabet, some drew pictures, some re ad books, and some \n",
      "even did calisthenics. The girl next to Totto-chan already knew al l her alphabet and \n",
      "was writing it into her notebook. It was all so unfamiliar that Totto-chan was a bit \n",
      "nervous and unsure what to do. \n",
      "Just then the boy sitting behind her got up and walked toward the blackboard with his \n",
      "notebook, apparently to consult the teacher. She sat at a desk beside t he blackboard \n",
      "and was explaining something to another pupil. Totto-chan stopped looking around \n",
      "the room and, with her chin cupped in her hands, fixed her eyes on his back as he \n",
      "walked. The boy dragged his leg, and his whole body swayed dreadfull y. Totto-chan \n",
      "wondered at first if he was doing it on purpose, but she soon realized the boy couldn't \n",
      "help it. \n",
      "Totto-chan went on watching him as the boy came back to his desk. Thei r eyes met. \n",
      "The boy smiled. Totto-chan hurriedly smiled back. When he sat down at  the desk \n",
      "behind her--it took him longer than other children to sit down--she turned a round and \n",
      "asked, \"Why do you walk like that?\" \n",
      " 13  He replied quietly, with a gentle voice that sounded intelligent, \"I  had polio.\" \n",
      "\"Polio?\" Totto-chan repeated, never having heard the word before. \n",
      "\"Yes, polio,\" he whispered. \"It's not only my leg, but my hand, too. \" He held it out. \n",
      "Totto-chan looked at his left hand. His long fingers were bent and looked a s if they \n",
      "were stuck together. \n",
      "“Can't they do anything about it?\" she asked, concerned. He didn't r eply, and Totto-\n",
      "chan became embarrassed, wishing she hadn't asked. But the boy sa id brightly, \"My \n",
      "name's Yasuaki Yamamoto. What's yours?\" \n",
      "She was so glad to hear him speak in such a cheerful voice that s he replied loudly, \n",
      "\"I'm Totto-chan.\" \n",
      "That's how Yasuaki Yamamoto and Totto-chan became friends. \n",
      "The sun made it quite hot inside the train. Someone opened a window. The f resh \n",
      "spring breeze blew through the car and tossed the children's hair a bout with carefree \n",
      "abandon. \n",
      "In this way Totto-chan's first day at Tomoe began. \n",
      "Sea Food and Land Food \n",
      "Now it was time for \"something from the ocean and something from the hills,\" the \n",
      "lunch hour Totto-chan had looked forward to so eagerly. \n",
      "The headmaster had adopted the phrase to describe a balanced meal --the kind of food \n",
      "he expected you to bring for lunch in addition to your rice. Instead of t he usual \n",
      "\"Train your children to eat everything,\" and \"Please see that they bring a nutritiously \n",
      "balanced lunch,\" this headmaster asked parents to include in their c hildren's \n",
      "lunchboxes \"something from the ocean and something from the hills.\" \n",
      "\"Something from the ocean\" meant sea food-- things such as fish and tsukuda-ni \n",
      "(tiny crustaceans and the like boiled in soy sauce and sweet sake ), while \"something \n",
      "from the hills\" meant food from the land--like vegetables, beef, pork, and chicken. \n",
      "Mother was very impressed by this and thought that few headmaste rs were capable \n",
      "of expressing such an important rule so simply. Oddly enough, just havi ng to choose \n",
      "from two categories made preparing lunch seem simpler. And bes ides, the \n",
      "headmaster pointed out that one did not have to think too hard or be extravaga nt to \n",
      "fulfill the two requirements. The land food could be just kinpira gobo  (spicy \n",
      "burdock) or an omelette, and the sea food merely flakes of dried bonito. Or simpler \n",
      "still, you could have nori (a kind of seaweed) for \"ocean\" and a pickled plum for \n",
      "\"hills.\" \n",
      "Just as the day before, when Totto-chan had watched so enviously, the headmaster \n",
      "came and looked in all the lunchboxes. \n",
      " 14  \"Have you something from the ocean and something from the hills?\" he  asked, \n",
      "checking each one. It was so exciting to discover what each had brou ght from the \n",
      "ocean and from the hills. \n",
      "Sometimes a mother had been too busy and her child had only something from  the \n",
      "hills, or only something from the ocean. But never mind. As the hea dmaster made his \n",
      "round of inspection, his wife followed him, wearing a cook's white ap ron and holding \n",
      "a pan in each hand. If the headmaster stopped in front of a pupil saying , \"Ocean,\" she \n",
      "would dole out a couple of boiled chikuwa  (fish rolls) from the \"Ocean\" saucepan, \n",
      "and if the headmaster said, \"Hills,\" out would come some chunks of s oy-simmered \n",
      "potato from the \"Hills\" saucepan. \n",
      "No one would have dreamed of saying, \"I don't like fish rolls,\" any  more than \n",
      "thinking what a fine lunch so-and-so has or what a miserable lunch poor so-and-so \n",
      "always brings. The children's only concern was whether they had s atisfied the two \n",
      "requirements - the ocean and the hills--and if so their joy was  complete and they \n",
      "were all in good spirits. \n",
      "Beginning to understand what \"something from the ocean and something f rom the \n",

      "Totto-chan's lunch contained bright yellow scrambled eggs, green pea s, brown \n",
      "denbu, and pink naked cod roe. It was as colorful as a newer garden. \n",
      "\"How very pretty,\" said the headmaster. \n",
      "Totto-chan was thrilled. \"Mother's a very good cook,\" she said. \n",
      "\"She is, is she?\" said the headmaster. Then he pointed to the denbu . \"All right. \n",
      "What's this! Is it from the ocean or the hills?\" \n",
      "Totto-chan looked at it, wondering which was right. It was the color  of earth, so \n",
      "maybe it was from the hills. But she couldn't be sure. \n",
      "\"I don't know,\" she said. \n",
      "The headmaster then addressed the whole school, \"Where does denbu  come from, the \n",

      "After a pause, while they thought about it, some shouted, \"Hills,\"  and others shouted, \n",
      "\"Ocean,\" but no one seemed to know for certain. \n",
      "\"All right. I’ll tell you,\" said the headmaster. “ Denbu  is from the ocean.” \n",
      "\"Why?\" asked a fat boy. \n",
      "Standing in the middle of the circle of desks, the headmaster ex plained, “ Denbu  is \n",

      "chan's denbu . \n",
      "\"Certainly,\" said the headmaster, and the whole school trooped over to look at Totto-\n",
      "chan's denbu. There must have been children who knew what denbu  was but whose \n",
      "interest had been aroused, as well as those who wanted to see if Totto-chan's denbu  \n",
      "was any different from the kind they had at home. So many childre n sniffed at Totto-\n",
      "chan's denbu that she was afraid the bits might get blown away. \n",
      "Totto-chan was a little nervous that first day at lunch, but it w as fun. It was \n",
      "fascinating wondering what was sea food and what was land food, and s he learned \n",
      "that denbu was made of fish, and Mother had remembered to include somet hing from \n",
      "the ocean and something from the hills, so all in all everything ha d been all right, she \n",
      "thought contentedly. \n",
      "And the next thing that made Totto-chan happy was that when she star ted to eat the \n",

      "“Chew It Well!” \n",
      "Normally one starts a meal by saying, \" Iradokimasu \" (I gratefully partake), but \n",
      "another thing that was different at Tomoe Gakuen was that first  of all everybody \n",
      "sang a song. The headmaster was a musician and he had made up a s pecial \"Song to \n",
      "Sing before Lunch.\" Actually, he just made up the words and set them  to the tune of \n",
      "the well-known round \"Row, Row, Row Your Boat.\" The words the headmast er \n",
      "made up went like this: \n",
      " \n",
      "Chew, chew, chew it well, \n",
      "Everything you eat; \n",
      "Chew it and chew it and chew it and chew it, \n",
      "Your rice and fish and meat! \n",
      "It wasn't until they had finished singing this song that the childr en all said \n",
      "\"ltadakimasu.\"  \n",
      "The words fitted the tune of \"Row, Row, Row Your Boat\" so well tha t even years \n",
      "later many of the pupils firmly believed it had always been a song you sang before \n",
      "eating. \n",
      "The headmaster may have made up the song because he had lost some of  his teeth, \n",
      "but he was always telling the children to ear slowly and take plent y of time over \n",
      "meals while enjoying pleasant conversation, so it is more likel y he made up this song \n",
      "to remind them of that. \n",
      "After they had sung the song at the tops of their voices, the c hildren all said \n",

      "a unanimous shout. \n",
      "\"A walk!\" \n",
      "\"All right,\" said the teacher, and the children all began rushing  to the doors and \n",
      "dashing out. Totto-chan used to go for walks with Daddy and Rocky, but  she had \n",
      "never heard of a school walk and was astounded. She loved walks, however, so she \n",

      "sixth grade. \n",
      "Out of the gate they went--all nine first grade pupils with thei r teacher in their midst-\n",
      "-and began walking along the edge of a stream. Both banks of the s tream were lined \n",
      "with large cherry trees that had only recently been in full bl oom. Fields of yellow \n",
      "mustard flowers stretched as far as the eve could see. The st ream has long since \n",

      "some yellow flowers, and said, \"Look at these mustard flowers. Do you know why \n",
      "flowers bloom?\" \n",
      "She explained about pistils and stamens while the children crouched by  the road and \n",
      "examined the flowers. The teacher told them how butterflies hel ped flowers bloom. \n",
      "And, indeed, the butterflies seemed very busy helping. \n",

      " 17  Totto-chan didn't think so either, but like the other children, she was sure that pistils \n",
      "and stamens were very important. \n",
      "After they had walked for about another ten minutes, a thickly wooded park came \n",
      "into view. It surrounded the temple called Kuhonbutsu. As they entered t he grounds \n",
      "the children scattered in various directions. \n",
      "\"Want to see the shooting-star well?\" asked Sakko-chan, and natura lly Totto-chan \n",
      "agreed and ran after her. \n",
      "The well looked as if it was made of stone and came up to their che sts. It had a \n",
      "wooden lid. They lifted the lid and peered in. It was pitch dark, and T otto-chan could \n",
      "see something like a lump of concrete or stone, but nothing whatsoever r esembling \n",
      "the twinkling star she had imagined. After staring inside for a long time, she asked, \n",
      "\"Have you seen the star?\" \n",
      "Sakko-chan shook her head. “No, never.” \n",
      "Totto-chan wondered why it didn't shine. After thinking about it for a w hile, she said, \n",

      "\"I think they must sleep in the daytime and then wake up at night and shi ne,\" said \n",
      "Totto-chan quickly because she wasn't really sure. \n",
      "Then the children gathered together and walked around the temple grounds. The y \n",

      "gate, guarding the temple, and gazed with awe at the statue of Buddha in the semi-\n",
      "darkness of the Main Hall. They placed their feet in the great footprint in a stone said \n",
      "to have been made by a Tengu - a long-nosed goblin. They strolled ar ound the pond, \n",
      "calling out “Hello!” to the people in rowboats. And they played hopsc otch to their \n",
      "hearts' content with the glossy black pebbles around the graves. Eve rything was new \n",
      "to Totto-chan, and she greeted each discovery with an excited shout. \n",
      "\"Time to go back!\" said the teacher, as the sun began to dip, and the children set off \n",
      "for the school along the road between the mustard blossoms and the cherr y trees. \n",
      "Little did the children realize then that these walks--a time of freedom and play for \n",

      "\"Let's go for a walk again tomorrow!\" she shouted to them all on t he way back. \n",
      "\"Yes, let's!\" they shouted back, hopping and skipping. \n",

      "Each day at Tomoe Gakuen was filled with surprises for Totto-ch an. So eager was \n",
      "she to go to school that mornings never dawned soon enough. And when she got \n",
      "home she couldn't stop talking—telling Rocky and Mother and Daddy all about what \n",
      "she had done at school that day and what fun it had been, and all the surpr ises. \n",
      "Mother would finally have to say, \"That's enough, dear. Stop tal king and have your \n",
      "afternoon snack.\" \n",
      "Even when Totto-chan was quite accustomed to the new school, she stil l had \n",
      "mountains of things to talk about every day. And Mother rejoiced to think that this \n",
      "was so. \n",
      "One day, on her way to school in the train, Totto-chan suddenly began wonder ing \n",
      "whether Tomoe had a school song. Wanting to find out as soon as possible, she could \n",
      "hardly wait to get there. Although there were still two more st ations to go, she went \n",
      "and stood by the door, ready to jump out as soon as the train pulled into Jiyugaoka. A \n",
      "lady getting on at the station before saw the little girl at t he door and naturally \n",
      "thought she was getting off. When the child remained motionless--poise d like a \n",
      "runner, all set and \"on your marks\"- the lady muttered, “I wonder what's the matter \n",
      "with her.” \n",
      "When the train arrived at the station, Totto-chan was off it in a flash. By the time the \n",
      "young conductor was calling out, \"Jiyugaoka! Jiyugaoka!\"--one foot smartly on the \n",
      "platform before the train had come to a proper halt-Totto-chan had al ready \n",
      "disappeared through the exit. \n",
      "The moment she was inside the railroad-car classroom, Totto-chan asked Taiji \n",
      "Yamanouchi, who was already there, \"Tai-chan, does this school have  a song?\" \n",
      "Tai-chan, who liked physics, replied after some thought, \"I don't think it has.\" \n",
      "\"Oh,\" said Totto-chan, pensively. \"Well, I think it ought to. We ha d a lovely one at \n",
      "my other school.\" \n",
      "She began singing it at the top of her voice: \n",
      "Tho' shallow the waters of Senzoku Pond, \n",
      "Deep is our learning of vistas beyond ... \n",
      "Totto-chan had only gone to the school a short time, and the words were difficult, but \n",
      "she had no trouble remembering the song. That part, at any rate.  \n",
      "Tai-chan seemed impressed. By this time other pupils had arrived,  and they, too, \n",
      "seemed impressed by the big words she used. \n",
      "\"Let's get the headmaster to make up a school song!\" said Totto -chan. \n",
      "\"Yes, let's!\" agreed the others, and they all trooped over to the  headmaster's office. \n",
      " 19  After listening to Totto-chan sing the song from the other school and after \n",
      "considering the children's request, the headmaster said, “All r ight, I'll have a school \n",

      "Next morning, there was a notice in each classroom requiring ever yone to assemble \n",
      "in the school grounds. Totto-chan joined the others, all agog. Bringi ng a blackboard \n",
      "out into the center of the grounds, the headmaster said, \"Now then, here's a song for \n",
      "Tomoe, your school.\" He drew five parallel lines on the blackboard and wrote out the \n",
      "following notes: \n",
      "Then he raised both his arms like a conductor, saying, \"Now let's t ry and sing it, all \n",

      "\"Is that all there is?\" asked Totto-chan, after a brief pause . \n",
      "\"Yes, that's all,\" said the headmaster, proudly. \n",
      "\"Something with fancy words would have been nicer,\" said Totto-chan in a terribly \n",
      "disappointed voice. \"Something like 'Tho' shallow the waters of Se nzoku Pond.' \" \n",
      "\"Don't you like it?\" asked the headmaster, flushed but smiling. \" I thought it was \n",
      "rather good.\" \n",
      "Nobody liked it. It was far too simple. They'd rather have no song  at all, it appeared, \n",
      "than anything as simple as that. \n",
      "The headmaster seemed rather sorry, but he wasn't angry, and proc eeded to wipe it \n",
      "off the blackboard. Totto-chan felt that they had been rather rude , but after all she \n",
      "had something a bit more impressive in mind. \n",
      "The truth was that nothing could have expressed the headmaster's love f or the \n",
      "children and the school more, but the children weren't old enough to real ize that. \n",
      "They soon forgot about wanting a school song, and the headmaster probably ne ver \n",
      "considered one necessary in the first place. So when the tune had bee n rubbed off the \n",

      "“Put It All Back!\" \n",
      "Totto-chan had never labored so hard in her life. What a day that was when she \n",
      "dropped her favorite purse down the toilet! It had no money in it, but Tott o-chan \n",
      "loved the purse so much she even took it to the toilet with her. It was  a truly beautiful \n",
      " 20  purse made of red, yellow, and green checked taffeta. It was s quare and flat, with a \n",
      "silver Scotch terrier rather like a brooch over the triangular flap of the fastening. \n",
      "Now Totto-chan had a curious habit. Ever since she was small, w henever she went to \n",
      "the toilet, she made it a point to peer down the hole after she had finished. \n",
      "Consequently, even before she started going to elementary school, she had already \n",
      "lost several hats, including a straw one and a white lace one. T oilets, in those days, \n",
      "had no flush systems, only a sort of cesspool underneath, so the hats were usually left \n",
      "floating there. Mother was always telling Totto-chan not to peer down the hole after \n",
      "she had finished using the toilet. \n",
      "That day, when Totto-chan went to the toilet before school started,  she forgot \n",
      "Mother's warning, and before she knew it, she found herself peeri ng down the hole. \n",
      "She must have Loosened her hold on the purse at that moment, for it slippe d out of \n",
      "her hand and dropped down the hole with a splash. Totto-chan let out a cry as it \n",
      "disappeared into the darkness below. \n",
      "But Totto-chan refused to shed tears or give up the purse as lost. S he went to the \n",
      "janitor's shed and got a large, long-handled wooden ladle used for waterin g the \n",
      "garden. The handle was almost twice as long as she was, but tha t did not deter her in \n",
      "the least. She went around with it to the back of the school and trie d to find the \n",
      "opening through which the cesspool was emptied. She imagined it would be  on the \n",
      "outside wall of the toilet, but after searching in vain she final ly noticed a round \n",
      "concrete manhole cover about a yard away. Lifting it off with dif ficulty, she \n",
      "discovered an opening that was undoubtedly the one she was looking for. S he put her \n",
      "head inside. \n",
      "\"Why, it's as big as the pond at Kuhonbutsu!\" she exclaimed. \n",
      "Then she began her task. She started ladling out the contents of the ce sspool. At first \n",
      "she tried the area in which she had dropped the purse. But the tank wa s deep and \n",
      "dark and quite extensive, since it served three separate toilets . Moreover, she was in \n",
      "danger of falling in herself if she put her head in too far, so she d ecided to just keep \n",
      "on ladling and hope for the best, emptying her ladle onto the ground around the  hole. \n",
      "She inspected each ladleful, of course, to see if it contained the purse. She hadn't \n",
      "thought it would take her long to find, but there was no sign of the purse . Where \n",
      "could it be? The bell rang for the beginning of class. \n",
      "What should she do, she wondered, but having gone so far she decided to c ontinue. \n",
      "She ladled with renewed vigor. \n",
      "There was quite a pile on the ground when the headmaster happened to pa ss by. \n",
      "\"What are you doing?\" he asked Totto-chan. \n",
      "\"I dropped my purse,\" she replied, as she went on ladling, not want ing to waste a \n",
      "moment. \n",
      "\"I see,\" said the headmaster, and walked away, his hands claspe d behind his back as \n",
      "was his habit when he went for a stroll. \n",
      " 21  Time went by and she still hadn't found the purse. \n",
      "The foul-smelling pile was getting higher and higher. \n",
      "The headmaster came by again. \"Have you found it?\" he inquired. \n",
      "\"No,\" replied Totto-chan, from the center of the pile, sweating profusely, her cheeks \n",

      "The headmaster came closer and said in a friendly tone, \"You'll  put it all back when \n",
      "you've finished, won't you?\" Then he went off again, as he had done before. \n",
      "\"Yes,\" Totto-chan replied cheerfully, as she went on with her work.  Suddenly a \n",

      "stuff back, but what do I do about the water?\" \n",
      "The liquid portion was disappearing fast into the earth. Totto-chan stoppe d working \n",
      "and tried to figure out how she could get that part back into the tank, too, since she \n",
      "had promised the headmaster to put it all back. She finally decided the thing to do \n",
      "was to put in some of the wet earth. \n",
      "The pile was a real mountain by now and the tank was almost empty , but there was \n",
      "still no sign of the purse. Maybe it had stuck to the rim of the t ank or to the bottom. \n",
      "But Totto-chan didn't care. She was satisfied she had done all she  could. Totto-chan's \n",
      "satisfaction was undoubtedly due in part to the self-respect the he admaster made her \n",
      "feel by not scolding her and by trusting her. But that was too complicated for Totto-\n",
      "chan to realize then. \n",
      "Most adults, on discovering Totto-chan in such a situation, would have rea cted by \n",
      "exclaiming, \"What on earth are you doing!\" or \"Stop that, it's dang erous!\" or, \n",

      "After the incident, Totto-chan never peered down the hole any more after using the \n",

      "liked him more than ever. \n",
      "Totto-chan kept her promise and put everything back into the tank. It wa s a terrible \n",
      "job getting it out, but putting it back was much quicker. She put some of the wet \n",
      "earth in, too. Then she smoothed the ground, put the cover back properly, and took \n",
      "the ladle back to the janitor's shed. \n",
      "That night before she went to bed Totto-chan thought about the beautiful pur se she \n",

      "character for toru  (which means to penetrate, to carry far, to be clear and res onant, as \n",

      "So everybody called her Tetsuko-chan (chan is the familiar form of the san used after \n",

      "more comedians on the radio.\" \n",
      "When Totto-chan was a little girl, radios were large and made o f wood. They were \n",
      "very elegant. Theirs was rectangular with a rounded top, and a big  speaker in front \n",
      "covered with pink silk and carved arabesques. It had two control knobs. \n",
      "Even before she started school, Totto-chan liked to listen to  rakugo  comedians, \n",
      "pressing her ear against the pink silk. She thought their jokes were  terribly funny. \n",
      "Mother had never objected to her listening to them until yesterday. \n",
      "Last night some of Daddy's friends from the orchestra came to their house to practice \n",
      "string quartets in the living room. \n",
      "\"Mr. Tsunesada Tachibana, who plays the cello, has brought you some ba nanas,\" \n",
      "said Mother. \n",
      "Totto-chan was thrilled. She bowed politely to Mr. Tachibana, and by way of thanks \n",
      "exclaimed to her mother, \"Hey, Ma, this is pretty goddam good!\"  \n",
      "After that Totto-chan had to listen in secret when Mother and Dadd y were out. When \n",
      "the comedians were good, she would laugh uproariously. If any grown- ups had been \n",
      "watching, they might well have wondered how such a small girl coul d understand \n",
      "such difficult jokes. But there's no doubt that children have an innate s ense of humor. \n",

      "\"I wonder what route it will take to get to the school,\" someone said. \n",

      "that level crossing,\" someone suggested. \n",
      "\"Then it would have to derail,\" said someone else. \n",
      "\"Maybe they'll just bring it on a cart,\" said another. \n",
      "\"There wouldn't be a cart big enough to hold one of those cars,\" some one pointed out \n",
      "immediately. \n",
      "“I suppose not...” \n",
      "Ideas petered out. The children realized a railroad car certa inly wouldn't fit on a cart \n",
      "or even a truck. \n",
      "\"Rails!\" said Totto-chan after much thought. \n",
      "\"You know, they're probably going to lay some rails right here to the school!\" \n",
      "\"From where?\" asked someone. \n",
      "\"Where? From wherever the train is now,\" said Totto-chan, beginning  to think her \n",
      "idea wasn't such a good one, after all. She had no idea where the car was coming \n",
      "from, and, anyway, they wouldn't pull down houses and things in order to l ay tracks \n",
      "in a straight line to the school. \n",
      "After much fruitless discussion of one possibility after another, t he children finally \n",
      "decided not to go home that afternoon but to wait and see the car arriv e. Miyo-chan \n",
      "was elected to go and ask her father, the headmaster, if they  could all remain at \n",

      "ask permission. Then they can come back if they like with their pa jamas and a \n",

      "\"Wow!\" The children were more excited than ever. \n",

      "What mother could grasp the situation with that kind of explanation! Tot to-chan's \n",
      "mother had no idea what she meant. But judging by the serious look on her \n",
      "daughter's face, she guessed something unusual was afoot. \n",
      "Mother asked Totto-chan all sorts of questions. She finally discovere d what it was all \n",
      "about and what exactly was going to happen. She thought Totto-chan ought t o see it, \n",
      "as she wouldn't have many such opportunities. She even thought she'd like  to see the \n",
      "car arrive herself. \n",
      "Mother got out Totto-chan's pajamas and a blanket, and after dinner she  took her to \n",
      "the school. About ten children were there. They included some of the ol der students \n",
      "who had heard of the event. A couple of other mothers, too, had come with t heir \n",
      "children. They looked as if they would like to stay, but after entrus ting their children \n",
      "to the head-master's care, they went home. \n",
      "\"I’ll wake you up when  it comes,\" the children were assured by the headmaster as \n",
      "they lay down in the Assembly Hall wrapped in their blankets. \n",
      "The children thought they wouldn't be able to sleep for wondering how the  train \n",
      "would get there. \n",
      "But after so much excitement, they were tired and soon became drowsy. Before they \n",
      "could say, \"Be sure and wake me up,\" most of them fell fast a sleep. \n",
      "\"It's here! It's here!\" \n",
      "Awakened by a babble of voices, Totto-chan jumped up and ran through the school \n",
      "grounds and out the gate. A great big railroad car was just visible  in the morning \n",
      "haze. It was like a dream--a train coming along the road without  tracks making no \n",
      "sound. \n",
      "It had come on a large trailer pulled by a tractor from the Oi machi Line depot. Totto-\n",
      "chan and the others learned something they didn't know before--that t here was \n",
      "something called a tractor that could pull a trailer, which was much bigger than a \n",
      "cart. They were impressed. \n",
      "The car moved slowly along the deserted morning road mounted on the trai ler. \n",
      "Soon there was a great commotion. There were no giant cranes in t hose days, so to \n",
      "get the car off the trailer and to its destination in the school grounds was a \n",
      "tremendous operation. The men who brought it had to lay several big logs under the \n",
      "car and gradually roll it off the trailer onto the schoolyard. \n",
      "\"Watch carefully,\" said the headmaster, \"they're called roll ers. Rolling power is \n",
      "being used to move that big car.” \n",
      " 25  The children looked on earnestly. \n",
      "\"Heave-ho, heave-ho,\" chanted the workmen as they toiled, and the sun it self seemed \n",
      "to be rising in time to their rhythmic cries. \n",
      "Like the other six already at the school, this car, which had c arried so many people, \n",
      "had its wheels removed. Its traveling life was over. From now on it would carry the \n",
      "sound of children's laughter. \n",
      "As the boys and girls stood there in the morning sunshine in their paj amas, they were \n",
      "so happy they couldn't contain their joy and kept jumping up and down, cl asping the \n",
      "headmaster around the neck and swinging from his arms. \n",
      "Staggering under the onslaught, the headmaster smiled happily. See ing his joy, the \n",
      "children smiled, too. \n",
      "And none of them ever forgot how happy they were. \n",
      "The Swimming Pool  \n",
      "That was a red-letter day for Totto-chan. It was the first t ime she had ever swum in a \n",
      "pool. And without a stitch on! \n",
      "It happened in the morning. The headmaster said to them all, \"It' s become quite hot \n",
      "all of a sudden, so I think I'll fill the pool.\" \n",
      "\"Wow!\" everybody cried, jumping up and down. Totto-chan and the first gra de \n",
      "children cried \"Wow\" too, and jumped up and down with even greater exci tement \n",
      "than the older students. The pool at Tomoe was not rectangular like most pools, as \n",
      "one end was narrower than the other. It was shaped pretty much li ke a boat. The lay \n",
      "of the land probably had something to do with it. But nonetheless; the pool was a \n",
      "large and splendid one. It was situated between the classrooms and t he Assembly \n",
      "Hall. \n",
      "All during their lessons, Totto-chan and the others kept stealing gl ances out of the \n",
      "windows at the pool. When empty it had been littered with fallen le aves just like the \n",
      "playground. But now that it was clean and beginning to fill up, it st arted to look like \n",
      "a real swimming pool. \n",
      "Lunchtime finally arrived, and when the children were all gathered a round the pool, \n",
      "the headmaster said, “We'll do some exercises and then have a sw im.” \n",
      "\"Don't I need a swimsuit to go swimming?\" thought Totto-chan. When she went to \n",
      "Kamakura with Mother and Daddy, she took a swimsuit, a rubber ring,  and all sorts \n",
      "of things. She tried to remember if the teacher had asked them to bring swimsuits. \n",
      "Then, just as if he had read her thoughts, the headmaster said, \" Don't worry about \n",
      "swimsuits. Go and look in the Assembly Hall.\" \n",
      "When Totto-chan and the other first graders got to the Assembly Hal l the bigger \n",
      "children were taking off their clothes with shrieks of delight as  if they were going to \n",
      "have a bath. They ran our, one after the other, stark naked, into the school grounds. \n",
      " 26  Totto-chan and her friends hurriedly followed them. In the warm bree ze it felt \n",
      "wonderful not to have any clothes on. When they got to the top of the steps outside \n",
      "the Assembly Hall they found the others already doing warm-up exer cises. Totto-\n",
      "chan and \n",
      "her classmates ran down the steps in their bare feet. \n",
      "The swimming instructor was Miyo-chan's elder brother--the he admaster's son and \n",
      "an expert in gymnastics. He wasn't a teacher at Tomoe but he was on the swimming \n",
      "team of a university. His name was the same as the school's- -Tomoe. Tomoe-san \n",
      "wore swimming trunks. \n",
      "After their exercises, the children let out screams as cold water was poured over \n",
      "them, and then they jumped into the pool. Totto-chan didn't go in until she had \n",
      "watched some of the others and satisfied herself they could stand. It wasn't hot, like a \n",
      "bath but it was lovely and big, and as far as you could stretch your  arms there was \n",
      "nothing but water. \n",
      "Thin children, plump children, boys, girls - they were all laughi ng and shouting and \n",
      "splashing in their birthday suits. \n",
      "What fun, thought Totto-chan, and what a lovely feeling! She was only s orry Rocky \n",
      "couldn't come to school. She was sure that if he knew he could go in w ithout a \n",
      "swimsuit he'd be in the pool, too. \n",
      "You might wonder why the headmaster allowed the children to swim na ked. There \n",
      "were no rules about it. If you brought your suit and wanted to wear it, that was \n",
      "perfectly all right. On the other hand, like today, when you suddenly  decided to go in \n",
      "and hadn't a suit, that was perfectly all right, too. And why di d he let them swim in \n",
      "the nude! Because he thought it wasn't right for boys and girls to be morbidly curious \n",
      "about the differences in their bodies, and he thought it was unnatural for  people to \n",
      "take such pains to hide their bodies from other people. \n",
      "He wanted to teach the children that all bodies are beautiful. Among  the pupils at \n",
      "Tomoe were some who had had polio, like Yasuaki-chan, or were very small, or \n",
      "otherwise handicapped, and he felt if they bared their bodies and playe d together it \n",
      "would rid them of feelings of shame and help to prevent them developing a n \n",
      "inferiority complex. As it turned out, while the handicapped children were shy at \n",
      "first, they soon began to enjoy themselves, and finally they g ot over their shyness \n",
      "completely. \n",
      "Some parents were worried about the idea and provided their offspring with \n",
      "swimsuits which they insisted should always be worn. Little did t hey know how \n",
      "seldom the suits were used. Observing children like Totto-chan-who right from the \n",
      "start decided swimming naked was best--and those who said they had f orgotten to \n",
      "bring their suits and went in anyway, most of them became convinced it was much \n",
      "more fun swimming naked like the others, so all they did was make sure they took \n",
      "wet swimsuits home! Consequently, almost all the children at Tomoe  became as \n",
      "brown as berries all over, and there were hardly any with white s wimsuit marks. \n",

      " 27  The Report Card \n",
      "Looking neither right nor left, her bag flapping against her back, T otto-chan ran all \n",

      "terrible had happened. She had started running as soon as she was out of  the school \n",
      "gate. \n",
      "Once home, she opened the front door and called out, \"I'm back!\" and went  to look \n",
      "for Rocky. He was lying on the porch, cooling off, with his belly  flat against the \n",
      "floor. Totto-chan didn't say a word. She sat down in front of Rocky, t ook her bag off \n",
      "her back, and took out a report card. It was her very first report card. She opened it so \n",
      "Rocky could clearly see her marks. \n",
      "\"Look!\" she said proudly. There were A's and B's and other characte rs. Naturally, \n",
      "Totto-chan didn't know yet whether A was better than B or whether B was better than \n",
      "A, so it would have been even harder for Rocky to know. But Totto-chan wanted to \n",
      "show her very first report card to Rocky before anyone else, a nd she was sure Rocky \n",
      "would be delighted. \n",
      "When Rocky saw the paper in front of his face, he sniffed it, then gazed up at Totto-\n",
      "chan. \n",
      "\"You're impressed, aren't you?\" said Totto-chan. \"But it's full  of difficult words so \n",
      "you probably can't read all of it.\" \n",
      "Rocky tilted his head as if he was having another good look at the ca rd. Then he \n",
      "licked Totto-chan's hand. \n",
      "\"Good,\" she said with satisfaction, getting up. “Now I'll go and s how it to Mother.” \n",
      "After Totto-chan had gone, Rocky got up and found himself a cooler spot.  Then he \n",
      "let himself down again slowly, and closed his eyes. It wasn't only Totto-chan who \n",
      "would have said that the way his eyes were closed it really s eemed as if he was \n",

      "Summer Vacation Begins \n",
      "\"We are going camping tomorrow. Please come to the school in the evening with \n",
      "blankets and pajamas,\" said the note from the headmaster that Tott o-chan took home \n",
      "and showed to Mother. Summer vacation began the following day. \n",
      "\"What does camping mean?\" asked Totto-chan. \n",
      "Mother was wondering, too, but she replied, \"Doesn't it mean you'r e probably going \n",
      "to put up tents somewhere outdoors and sleep in them? Sleeping in a tent you can see \n",
      "the moon and the stars. I wonder where they'll set up the tents. T here's no mention of \n",
      "fares so it's probably somewhere near the school.\" \n",
      "That night, after Totto-chan had gone to bed, she couldn't get to sle ep for ages. The \n",

      "beat very fast. \n",
      " 28  The following morning she started packing as soon as she woke up. But  that evening, \n",
      "as her blanket was placed on top of the knapsack that held her pajamas  and she said \n",
      "goodbye and set off, she felt very small and frightened. \n",
      "When the children were gathered at the school, the headmaster sa id, \"Now then, all \n",
      "of you, come to the Assembly Hall.\" When they got there he went up ont o the small \n",

      "carefully.” \n",
      "All alone, puffing and blowing, he pulled ropes this way and set up pole s that way, \n",
      "and before you could say \"Jack Robinson,\" there stood a beautiful tent! \n",

      "Mother imagined, as anyone would have, that they would put up the tents outdoors, \n",
      "but the head-master had other ideas. In the Assembly Hall the chil dren would be all \n",

      "With delighted shouts of “We're camping, we're camping!” the chil dren divided into \n",
      "groups, and, with the help of the teachers, they finally managed to set up the required \n",
      "number of tents. One tent could sleep about three children. Totto-chan qui ckly got \n",
      "into her pajamas, and soon children were happily crawling in and out of this tent and \n",
      "that one. There was much visiting to and fro. \n",
      "When everyone was in pajamas, the headmaster sat down in the middle  where they \n",
      "could all see him and talked to them about his travels abroad. \n",
      "Some of the children lay in their tents with just their heads showi ng, while others sat \n",
      "up properly, and some lay with their heads on older children's laps, all listening to his \n",
      "tales of foreign countries they had never seen and sometimes never even heard of. \n",
      "The headmaster's stories were fascinating, and at times the y felt as if the children \n",
      "described in lands across the sea were friends. \n",
      "And so it happened that this simple event--sleeping in tents in the A ssembly Hall-- \n",
      "became for the children a happy and valuable experience they would never  forget. \n",
      "The headmaster certainly knew how to make children happy. \n",
      "When the headmaster finished speaking and the light in the Assembly Ha ll had been \n",

      "some; whispers from others; while from a tent at the far end c ame the sound of a \n",
      "scuffle. Gradually silence fell. \n",
      "It was camping without any moon or stars, but the children enjoyed it thoroughly. To \n",

      "Two days after they camped in the Assembly Hall, the day of Tot to-chan's great \n",

      "And it was a secret that neither Mother nor Daddy nor Yasuaki-cha n's parents knew. \n",
      "She had invited Yasuaki-chan to her tree. \n",
      "The students at Tomoe each had a tree in the school grounds they consider ed their \n",
      "own climbing tree. Totto-chan's tree was at the edge of the grounds near the fence \n",
      "beside the lane leading to Kuhonbutsu. It was a large tree and sli ppery to climb, but \n",
      "if you climbed it skillfully you could get to a fork about six feet from the ground. \n",
      "The fork was as comfortable as a hammock. Totto-chan used to go ther e during \n",
      "recess and after school and sit and look off into the distance or up at the sky, or \n",
      "watch the people going by below. \n",
      "The children considered \"their\" trees their own private property, s o if you wanted to \n",

      "\"Excuse me, may I come in!\" \n",
      "Because Yasuaki-chan had had polio he had never climbed a tree, and coul dn't claim \n",
      "one as his own. That's why Totto-chan decided to invite him to her t ree. They kept it \n",
      "a secret because they thought people were sure to make a fuss if t hey knew. \n",
      "When she left home, Totto-chan told her mother she was going to visit  Yasuaki-chan \n",
      "at his home in Denenchofu. She was telling a lie, so she tried not to look at Mother \n",
      "but kept her eyes on her shoelaces. But Rocky followed her to the st ation, so when \n",
      "they parted company, she told him the truth. \n",

      "now that it was summer vacation. He was only a year older than T otto-chan, but he \n",
      "always sounded much older when he spoke. \n",
      "When Yasuaki-chan saw Totto-chan, he hurried toward her, dragging his l eg and \n",
      "holding his arms out in front to steady himself. Totto-chan was thr illed to think they \n",
      "were going to do something secret, and she giggled. Yasuaki-chan g iggled, too. \n",
      "Totto-chan led Yasuaki-chan to her tree, and then, just as she had thought  it out the \n",
      "night before, she ran to the janitor's shed and got a ladder, which she dragged over to \n",

      "Yasuaki-chan's arms and legs were so weak it seemed he could not even get on the \n",

      "Japanese. \n",
      "Josef Rosenstock, Daddy had told her, was a very famous conductor in Eur ope, but a \n",
      "man called Hitler was starting to do terrible things there, so Mr. Rosenstock had to \n",

      "Koscak Yamada had founded would probably never have made such progress i n the \n",

      "Rosenstock demanded of the orchestra the same level of performance he  would have \n",
      "expected from a first-class orchestra in Europe. That's why Rosenstock always wept \n",

      "\"I try so hard and you don't respond.\" \n",
      " 34  Hideo Saito, the cellist, who used to conduct while Rosenstock was re sting, spoke \n",

      "technique is still not good enough. I assure you our failure is not deli berate.\" \n",
      "The intricacies of the situation escaped her, but sometimes M r. Rosenstock would get \n",
      "so red in the face it seemed as if steam should be coming out of his  head, and he \n",
      "began shouting in German. At times like that, Totto-chan would retire  from her \n",
      "favorite window where she had been watching--chin in hands--and would crouc h on \n",
      "the ground with Rocky, hardly daring to breathe, and wait for the  music to begin \n",
      "again. \n",
      "But normally Mr. Rosenstock was very nice and his Japanese was quit e amusing. \n",
      "\"Very good, Kuroyanagi-san,\" he would say with a funny accent whe n they had \n",
      "played well. Or, \"Wonderful!\" \n",
      "Totto-chan had never been inside the rehearsal hall. She liked to pee k in at the \n",

      "\"Oh, there you are, Totsky!\" he would say. \n",
      "If Mr. Rosenstock spotted her he'd say, “Good morning\" or \"Good day\" in his funny \n",

      "little and put his cheek against hers. It embarrassed her a bit,  but she liked Mr. \n",
      "Rosenstock. He wore glasses with thin silver rims and had a larg e nose and was not \n",
      "very tall. But he had a fine handsome face that you could immedi ately recognize as \n",
      "an artist's. \n",

      "many things surprised Mother, but when Totto-chan came home from sc hool one day \n",

      "She had heard of old people visiting hot springs in groups but not first graders. But \n",
      "after she read the headmaster's letter carefully, she thought it was an excellent idea \n",
      "and was filled with admiration for his plan. The trip was to be a \"Seaside School\" at \n",
      "a place called Toi on the Izu Peninsula in Shizuoka. There was a hot  spring right in \n",
      "the sea, where the children could both swim and take hot baths. The tri p would last \n",
      "three days and two nights. The father of one of the Tomoe students had a vacation \n",
      "home there, where all fifty of the Tomoe students from first t hrough sixth grades \n",
      "could stay. Mother, of course, agreed. \n",
      " 35  The Tomoe students assembled at the school on the appointed day before se tting off. \n",
      "\"Now then,\" said the headmaster when they were all together. \"W e're traveling by \n",
      "train and by ship, and I don't want any of you to get lost. Do you unders tand! All \n",
      "right, off we go!\" \n",
      "That was the only instruction he gave, yet when they got on the Toy oko train at \n",
      "Jiyugaoka, the children were amazingly well behaved. Nobody ran up and down the \n",
      "cars, and the only talking was done quietly among those sitting next to each other. \n",
      "The Tomoe pupils had never once been told they should get in line and walk pr operly \n",
      "and keep quiet on the train and not drop litter on the floor when they ate t heir food. \n",
      "Their daily school life had somehow instilled into them that they mus tn't push people \n",
      "smaller or weaker than themselves; that unruly behavior was some thing to be \n",
      "ashamed of; that whenever they came across litter they should pi ck it up; and that \n",
      "they should try not to do anything that annoyed or disturbed others. Stra ngest of all \n",
      "was that Totto-chan, who only a few months before had been upsetting h er whole \n",
      "school by talking to street musicians out of the window in the middle  of class, stayed \n",
      "at her desk and did her lessons properly from the very day she starte d at Tomoe. If \n",
      "any of the teachers from the other school could have seen her now, si tting properly \n",
      "with the others in the train, they would have said, \"It must be som eone else!\" \n",
      "At Numazu they embarked on a ship that was just like what they ha d all dreamed \n",
      "about. It wasn't a big ship, but they were all so excited that t hey inspected every \n",
      "corner of the deck, feeling this or hanging from that. When it fina lly sailed, the \n",
      "children waved to the townsfolk on the pier. They hadn't gone far befo re it started to \n",
      "rain, however, and they had to go inside. Soon the sea became very rou gh. Totto-\n",
      "chan began to feel ill, as did some others. But just then, one of the older boys got up \n",
      "and stood amidships, pretending to be a stabilizer. When the ship rolled he  would run \n",
      "to one side, saying \"Oops!\" Then he would run the other way with another  \"Oops!\" It \n",
      "was so funny the children couldn't help laughing even though they felt so seasick, \n",
      "and they were still laughing when the ship arrived at Toi. The cur ious thing was that \n",
      "after they disembarked, the poor \"Oops\" boy began to feel sick just when everyone \n",
      "else had recovered and was feeling fine! \n",
      "Toi Spa was in a quiet, beautiful village on the sea surrounded by woode d hills. After \n",
      "a short rest the teachers took the children down to the sea. It wa sn't like the \n",
      "swimming pool at school so they wore their swimsuits. \n",
      "The hot spring in the sea was most unusual. It was not enclosed so the re was no line \n",
      "to set off the hot spring from the rest of the sea. If you crouche d down where you \n",
      "were told was the hot spring, the hot water came up to your neck and it felt lovely, \n",
      "just like being in a hot bath. If you wanted to go into the sea from the hot spring, all \n",
      "you had to do was move about fifteen feet sideways, and the water gradually got \n",
      "cooler. The further you went, the colder it got, and you knew you were  in the sea. So, \n",
      "after you had been swimming about in the sea and began to feel cold, all you had to \n",
      "do was to hurry back to the hot spring and have a hot bath right up to your nec k! I \n",
      "was just like at home. And it looked so funny. While the bathing-cappe d children \n",
      "were swimming about normally in the regular sea, the ones in t he hot spring part \n",
      "were relaxing in a circle chatting just as if they were i n a bath. Anyone watching \n",
      "would have thought, \"Why even youngsters act just like old people when they get in \n",
      "a hot spring bath.\" \n",
      " 36  In those days the seashore was so deserted it was like being on th eir own private \n",
      "beach, and the children enjoyed this unusual hot spring sea-bathing to the  utmost. \n",
      "When they got back to the house in the evening after staying in the water so long, \n",
      "their fingers were a mass of wrinkles. \n",
      "Each night, once they were tucked into their quilts, the children took t urns telling \n",
      "ghost stories. Totto-chan and the other first graders got so frig htened they cried. But \n",
      "in spite of their tears, they would ask, \"And then what happened?\" \n",
      "Unlike camping inside the school and the Bravery Test, the three- day stay at Toi Spa \n",
      "was a real-life experience. For example, they were sent i n turns to buy vegetables \n",
      "and fish for dinner, and when strangers asked them what school they w ent to and \n",
      "where they were from, they had to answer politely. Some of the children nearly got \n",
      "lost in the woods. Others swam so far they couldn't get back and h ad everyone \n",
      "worried. Others cut their feet on broken glass on the beach. In eac h case everyone \n",
      "had to do their best to help. \n",
      "But mostly it was all fun. There was a forest full of cica das and a shop where you \n",
      "could buy popsicles. And they met a man on the beach who was building a  big \n",
      "wooden boat all by himself. It was already boat-shaped, and the f irst thing each \n",
      "morning they ran down to the beach to see how much more he had done. The ma n \n",
      "gave Totto-chan a very long and curly wood shaving. \n",
      "\"How about a souvenir photograph?\" asked the headmaster on the day they were to \n",
      "leave. They had never had a photograph taken of them all together and t he children \n",
      "were excited at the idea. But no sooner was the teacher ready with her camera than \n",
      "someone had gone to the toilet; then someone else had his gym shoes on the  wrong \n",
      "feet and had to change them around. When the teacher finally said, \" Is everyone \n",
      "ready?\" one or two of the children were lying on the ground, having become tired of \n",
      "holding their poses so long. The whole process took a very long time . \n",
      "But that photograph, with the sea in the background and each child posing ac cording \n",
      "to his or her fancy, became a treasured possession of each of them. One look at it and \n",
      "memories would flood back -- the boat trip, the hot spring, the ghost stories, and the \n",
      "\"Oops\" boy. Totto-chan never forgot that first happy summer vac ation. \n",
      "Those were the days when you could still find crayfish in the pond near  their house \n",
      "in Tokyo, and the garbage man's cart was pulled by a great big ox . \n",
      "Eurythmics \n",
      "After summer vacation was over, the second semester began, for in Japan the school \n",
      "year starts in April. In addition to the children in her own clas s, Totto-chan had made \n",
      "friends with all the older boys and girls, thanks to the various gathe rings during \n",
      "summer vacation. And she grew to like Tomoe Gakuen even more. \n",
      "Besides the fact that classes at Tomoe were different from those at ordinary schools, \n",
      "a great deal more time was devoted to music. There were all s orts of music lessons, \n",
      "which included a daily period of eurythmics--a special kind of rhy thmic education \n",
      "devised by a Swiss music teacher and composer, Emile Jaques-Dal croze. His studies \n",
      "first became known about 1904. His system was rapidly adopted all ove r Europe and \n",
      " 37  America and training and research institutes sprang up everyw here. Here is the story \n",
      "of how Dalcroze's eurhythmics came to be adopted at Tomoe. \n",
      "Before starting Tomoe Gakuen, the headmaster, Sosaku Kobayashi, we nt to Europe \n",
      "to see how children were being educated abroad. He visited a great  many elementary \n",
      "schools and talked to educators. In Paris, he met Dalcroze, a f ine composer as well as \n",
      "an educator. \n",
      "Dalcroze had spent a long rime wondering how children could be taught to hear and \n",
      "feel music in their minds lather than just with their ears; how to make them feel \n",
      "music as a thing of movement rather than a dull, lifeless subjec t; how to awaken a \n",
      "child's sensitivity. \n",
      "Eventually, after watching the way children jumped and skipped and rompe d about, \n",
      "he hit on the idea of creating rhythmic exercises, which he call ed eurythmics. \n",
      "Kobayashi attended the Dalcroze school in Paris for over a year and learned this \n",
      "system thoroughly. Many Japanese have been influenced by Dalcroz e --the composer \n",
      "Koscak Yamada; the originator o modern dance in Japan, Baku Ishii; the Kabuki \n",
      "actor \n",
      "Ichikawa Sadanji II; the modern drama pioneer Kaoru Osannai; the dancer Michio \n",
      "Ito. All of these people felt that Dalcroze's teachings were  fundamental to many of \n",
      "the arts. But Sosaku Kobayashi was the first to apply it to ele mentary education in \n",
      "Japan. \n",
      "If you asked him what eurythmics was, he would reply, \"It's a sport that refines the \n",
      "body's mechanism; a sport that teaches the mind how to use and contr ol the body; a \n",
      "sport that enables the body and mind to understand rhythm. Practicing eurythmics \n",
      "makes the personality rhythmical. And a rhythmical personality  is beautiful and \n",
      "strong, conforming to and obeying the laws of nature.\" \n",
      "Totto-chan's classes began with training the body to understand rhy thm. The \n",
      "headmaster would play the piano on the small stage in the Assembly Hall and the \n",
      "children, wherever they stood, would start walking in time to the musi c. They could \n",
      "walk in whatever manner they liked, except that it wasn't good to bump into others, \n",
      "so they tended to go in the same circular direction. If they thou ght the music was in \n",
      "two-beat time, they would wave their arms up and down, like a conductor , as they \n",
      "walked. As for their feet, they were not supposed to tramp heavily , but that didn't \n",
      "mean they were to walk with toes pointed either, as in ballet. T hey were told to walk \n",
      "completely relaxed, as if they were dragging their toes. T he most important thing was \n",
      "naturalness, so they could walk in any way they felt was right.  If the rhythm changed \n",
      "to three-beat time, they waved their arms accordingly and adjusted their pace to the \n",
      "tempo, walking faster or slower as required. They had to learn t o raise and lower \n",
      "their arms to fit rhythms up to six-beat time. Four-beat time  was simple enough: \n",
      "\"Down, around you, out to the sides, and up.” \n",
      "But when it came to five beats it was: \n",
      "\"Down, around you, out in front, out to the sides, and up.” \n",
      " 38  While for six beats, the arms went: \n",
      "\"Down, around you, out in front, around you again, out to the sides, and up.” \n",
      "So when the beat kept changing it was pretty difficult. \n",
      "What was even harder was when the headmaster would call out: \n",
      "\"Even if I change my tempo on the piano don't you change until I tell y ou to!\" \n",
      "Suppose they were walking in two-beat time and the music changed t o three beats, \n",
      "the children had to keep on walking in duple time while heating the tri ple rhythm. It \n",
      "was very hard, but the headmaster said it was to cultivate the children's powers of \n",
      "concentration. \n",
      "Finally he would shout, \"You can change now!\" \n",
      "With relief, the children would immediately change to the tripl e rhythm. But that was \n",
      "when they had to be especially alert. In the time it took to menta lly abandon the two \n",
      "beats and get the message to their muscles to adapt to three bea ts, the music might \n",
      "suddenly change to five-beat time! At first, their arms and l egs were all over the \n",
      "place  and there would be groans of “Teacher, wait! wait!” But with practice, the \n",
      "movements became pleasant to do, and the children even thought up variations  and \n",
      "enjoyed themselves. \n",
      "Usually each child moved individually, but sometimes a pair would decide  to act in \n",
      "unison, holding hands when the rhythm was in two-beat time; or they would try \n",
      "walking with their eyes closed. The only thing that was taboo was  conversation. \n",
      "Sometimes, when there was a parent-Teacher Association meeti ng the mothers \n",
      "would peek in through the window. It was lovely to watch—each child moving  arms \n",
      "and legs with ease, leaping about joyfully, in perfect time to the music. \n",
      "Thus, the purpose of eurythmics was first to train both mind and body to be \n",
      "conscious of rhythm, thereby achieving harmony between the spiri t and the flesh, \n",
      "and finally awakening the imagination and promoting creativity. \n",
      "The day she arrived at the school for the very first time, Tott o-chan had looked at the \n",
      "name on the gate and asked Mother, \"What does Tomoe mean?\" \n",
      "The tomoe is an ancient comma-shaped symbol, and for his school the headm aster \n",
      "had adopted the traditional emblem consisting of two tomoe  - one black and one \n",
      "white--united to form a perfect circle.  \n",
      "This symbolized his aim for the children: body and mind equally devel oped and in \n",
      "perfect harmony. \n",
      "The headmaster had included eurythmics in his school curriculum because he felt it \n",
      "was bound to have good results and help the children's personalities to grow \n",
      "naturally, without being affected by too much adult interference.  \n",
      " 39  The headmaster deplored contemporary education, with its emphasis on t he written \n",
      "word, which tended to atrophy a child's sensual perception of nature a nd intuitive \n",
      "receptiveness to the still small voice of God, which is inspirat ion. \n",
      "It was the poet Basho who wrote: \n",
      "Listen! a frog \n",
      "Jumping into the silence \n",
      "Of an ancient pond! \n",
      "Yet the phenomenon of a frog jumping into a pond must have been seen by ma ny \n",
      "others. Down through the ages and in the whole world, Watt and  Newton cannot \n",
      "have been the only ones to notice the steam from a boiling kettle or observe an apple \n",
      "fall. \n",
      "Having eyes, but not seeing beauty; having ears, but not hearing mus ic; having \n",
      "minds, but not perceiving truth; having hearts that are never moved and the refore \n",
      "never set on fire. These are the things to fear, said the headmas ter. \n",
      "As for Totto-chan, as she leaped and ran about in her bare feet, li ke Isadora Duncan, \n",
      "she was tremendously happy and could hardly believe that this was par t of going to \n",
      "school! \n",
      "“The Only Thing I Want!”  \n",
      "It was the first time Totto-chan had ever been to a temple fair . In the middle of \n",
      "Senzoku Pond, near her former school, was a small island with a shri ne dedicated to \n",
      "Benten, the goddess of beauty and music. On the night of the annual fa ir, as she \n",
      "walked along the dimly lit road with Mother and Daddy, the night wa s suddenly \n",
      "ablaze with lights as they reached the fair. Totto-chan poked her head inside each of \n",
      "the little stalls. There were strange sounds everywhere--s queaks and sizzles and \n",
      "pops--and all sorts of enticing aromas. Everything was new and stran ge. \n",
      "There were toy pipes, which you \"smoked\" by inhaling peppermint.  They were \n",
      "decorated with pictures of cats and dogs and Betty Poop. There wer e lollipops and \n",
      "cotton candy. There were bamboo guns - tubes through which you pushed piece s of a \n",
      "certain kind of plant stem to make a loud pop. \n",
      "A man by the side of the road was swallowing swords and eating glass; and there \n",
      "was a man selling a sort of powder you rubbed on the rim of a bowl to make it \n",
      "resound. There were magic golden rings that made money disappear, and pictures \n",
      "that developed when exposed to sunlight, and paper flowers that blossomed w hen \n",
      "dropped in a glass of water. As she walked along, her eyes dart ing this way and that, \n",
      "Totto-chan suddenly stopped. \n",
      "\"Oh, look!\" she cried, seeing a box full of yellow baby chicks all  cheeping away. \n",
      "\"I want one!\" she said, pulling Mother and Daddy over. \"Please buy me one! Please!\" \n",
      " 40  The chicks all turned toward Totto-chan and raised their little heads  to look at her, \n",
      "wiggling their tiny bottoms and cheeping even louder. \n",
      "\"Aren't they cute?\" Totto-chan thought she had never seen anything quit e so \n",
      "appealing in all her life, and she crouched down beside them. \n",
      "\"Please,\" she begged, looking up at Mother and Daddy. But to her am azement, her \n",
      "parents quickly tried to drag her away. \n",
      "\"But you said you'd buy me something, and this is the only thing I w ant!\" \n",
      "\"No, dear,\" said Mother quietly. “These poor chicks are going to die very soon.\" \n",
      "\"Why?\" asked Totto-chan, starting to cry. \n",
      "Daddy drew her aside so the vendor couldn't hear, and explained, \"They' re cute now, \n",
      "Totsky, but they're terribly weak, and they won't live long. You 'll only cry when it \n",
      "dies. That's why we don't want you to have one.\" \n",
      "But Totto-chan had set her heart on having a baby chick, and wouldn't  listen. \n",
      "\"I won't let it die! I'll look after it!\" \n",
      "Mother and Daddy kept trying to drag Totto-chan away from the box, bur she looked \n",
      "longingly at the chicks, and the chicks looked longingly at her, che eping even louder \n",
      "still. Totto-chan had made up her mind that the only thing she wanted w as a chick. \n",
      "She beseeched her parents, \"Please, please buy me one. \n",
      "Mother and Daddy were adamant. \n",
      "\"We don't want you to have one because it will only make you cry in the end.\" \n",
      "Totto-chan burst out crying and started walking home with tears str eaming down her \n",
      "cheeks. Once they were back on the dark road, she said, sobbing convulsivel y, \"I've \n",
      "never wanted anything so much in my whole life. I’ll never ask you to buy me \n",
      "anything ever again. Please buy me one of those chicks!\" \n",
      "Finally Mother and Daddy gave in. \n",
      "It was like sunshine after rain. Totto-chan was all smiles now as she walked home \n",
      "carrying a small box containing two baby chicks. \n",
      "The next day, Mother had the carpenter make a special slatte d box, fitted with an \n",
      "electric light bulb to keep the chicks warm. Totto-chan watched the  chicks all day \n",
      "long. The little yellow chicks were very cute. But, alas, on the fourth day one of them \n",
      "stopped moving and on the fifth day the other did, too. She stroked them and c alled \n",
      "to them, but they didn't give a single \"cheep.\" She waited and wait ed but they never \n",
      "opened their eyes again. It was just as Mother and Daddy had said.  Crying to herself, \n",
      "she dug a hole in the garden and buried the two little birds. And she la id a tiny flower \n",
      "over the spot. The box they had been in now seemed awfully big and empty . \n",
      "Catching sight of a tiny yellow feather in the corner of the box , she thought of the \n",
      " 41  way the little chicks had cheeped when they saw her at the fai r, and she clenched her \n",
      "teeth as she cried soundlessly. \n",
      "She had never wanted anything so much in her life and now it was gone  so soon. It \n",
      "was her first experience of loss and separation. \n",
      "Their Worst Clothes \n",
      "The headmaster was always asking parents to send their children to school at Tomoe \n",
      "in their worst clothes. He wanted them to wear their worst clot hes so that it wouldn't \n",
      "matter if they got muddy and torn. He thought it a shame for chil dren to worry about \n",
      "being scolded if their clothes got dirty or to hesitate joining in some game because \n",
      "their clothes might get torn. There were elementary schools ne ar Tomoe where the \n",
      "girls were dressed in sailor-suit uniforms and the boys wore high -collared jackets \n",
      "with shorts. The Tomoe children came to school in their ordinary clothe s, and they \n",
      "had their teachers' permission to play to their hearts' content w ithout giving their \n",
      "clothes a thought. Trousers in those days weren't made of anything  durable like \n",
      "today's jeans, so all the boys had patches on their trousers and t he girls wore skirts or \n",
      "dresses made of the strongest material available. \n",
      "Totto-chan's favorite pastime was crawling under the fences of  other people's \n",
      "gardens and vacant lots, so it suited her very well not to have to t hink about her \n",
      "clothes. There were a lot of barbed-wire fences in those days, and some of them had \n",
      "wire right down to ground level. In order to get under one like that you had to burrow \n",
      "like a dog. No matter how careful she was, Totto-chan would always  manage to \n",
      "catch her dress on the barbs and tear it. Once, when she had on an old muslin dress \n",
      "that was really quite threadbare, the whole thing got shredded from  top to bottom. \n",
      "Although it was old, she knew Mother was very fond of that dress, so T otto-chan \n",
      "racked her brains about what to say. She hadn't the heart to tell Mother she had torn it \n",
      "on barbed wire. She thought it would be better to think up a lie that woul d make it \n",
      "sound as if she couldn't help tearing it. She finally hit on the fol lowing story. \n",
      "\"As I was walking along the road,\" she lied, on arriving home, \" a lot of children I \n",
      "didn't know threw knives at my back. That's why my dress got torn li ke this.\" But as \n",
      "she spoke she wondered how to answer further questions her mother might ask.  \n",
      "Thankfully, all her mother said was, \"It must have been awful!\" \n",
      "Totto-chan heaved a sigh of relief. Mother obviously realized that unde r chose \n",
      "circumstances she couldn't help getting Mother's favorite dress torn. \n",
      "Naturally, Mother didn't believe her story about the knives. Knives t hrown at her \n",
      "back would have injured her as well as tearing her dress, and Tot to-chan didn't seem \n",
      "at all frightened by the incident. Mother realized at once it was a fabrication. \n",
      "However, if was unusual for Totto-chan to go to such lengths to make up a n excuse. \n",
      "She realized Totto-chan must have felt badly about the dress and that  pleased her. \n",
      "But there was something Mother had wanted to know for some rime, and this seemed \n",
      "a good opportunity to find out. \n",
      "“I can see how your dresses can pet torn by knives and things like t hat,\" said Mother, \n",
      "\"but how do you manage to tear your panties too, day after day!\" \n",
      " 42  Mother could never understand how Totto-chan's lace-trimmed panties got torn every \n",
      "day around the rear. She could see how panties could get muddy and worn thin by \n",
      "going down slides or falling on one's bottom, but how did they get torn to shreds? \n",
      "Totto-chan thought about it for a while, then said, \"You see, when you bu rrow under \n",
      "a fence you can't help catching your skirt as you go through, and your pa nties when \n",
      "you back out, and you have to do an 'Excuse me, may I come in!' and a ' Well, \n",
      "goodbye then from one end of the fence to the other, so your panties a nd things are \n",
      "bound to tear.” \n",
      "Mother didn't really understand, but it sounded rather amusing. \n",
      "\"Is it fun?\" she asked. \n",
      "\"Why don't you try it?\" said Totto-chan, astonished at the question. \" It's great fun and \n",
      "you'll tear your panties, too!\" \n",
      "The game that Totto-chan liked so much and found so thrilling went like this. \n",
      "First you had to find a large vacant lot surrounded by a barbed-wi re fence. \"Excuse \n",
      "me, may I come in?\" consisted of lifting up the spiked wire, digg ing a hole, and \n",
      "crawling under. Once inside you lifted up a neighboring bit of barbed w ire and dug \n",
      "another hole, this time backing out saying, \"Well, goodbye then.\" I t became quite \n",
      "clear to Mother how Totto-chan's skirt got drawn up as she backed out causing her \n",
      "panties to catch on the barbed wire. The process would be repeated over and over \n",
      "again—burrowing under the wire with an \"Excuse me, may I come in? \" and then \n",
      "backing our through a fresh hole with a \"Well, goodbye then,\" tea ring skirt and \n",
      "panties every time. Totto-chan happily zigzagged back and forth burrow ing under the \n",
      "barbed-wire fence from one end to the other. No wonder her panties got  torn. \n",
      "To think that a game like that, which would only tire a grown-up and not  be amusing \n",
      "at all, could be such fun to a child! Watching Totto-chan, with dirt i n her hair and \n",
      "fingernails and even in her ears, Mother couldn't help feeling a  little envious. And \n",
      "she couldn't help admiring the headmaster. His suggestion that the c hildren wear \n",
      "clothes they could get as dirty as they liked was just another e xample of how well he \n",
      "understood them. \n",
      "Takahashi  \n",
      "One morning, when they were all running about the school grounds, the headm aster \n",
      "said, \"Here's a new friend for you. His last name is Takahas hi. He'll be joining the \n",
      "first grade train.\" \n",
      "The children, including Totto-chan, looked at Takahashi. He took off his hat and \n",
      "bowed, and said shyly, \"How do you do?\" \n",
      "Totto-chan and her classmates were still quite small, being onl y in the first grade, but \n",
      "Takahashi, although he was a boy, was much smaller still, wit h short arms and legs. \n",
      "His hands, in which he held his hat, were small, too. But he had br oad shoulders. He \n",
      "stood there looking forlorn. \n",
      " 43  \"Let's talk to him,\" said Totto-chan to Miyo-chan and Sakko-chan. They went over to \n",
      "Takahashi. As they approached him he smiled affably, and they smil ed back. He had \n",
      "big round eyes and looked as if he wanted to say something. \n",
      "\"Would you like to see the classroom in the train?\" Totto-chan offe red. \n",
      "\"Mm!\" replied Takahashi, putting his hat back on his head. \n",
      "Totto-chan was in a great hurry to show him the classroom and bounded over to the \n",
      "train, calling to him from the door, \"Hurry up.\" \n",
      "Takahashi seemed to be walking fast but was still a long way off . \n",
      "\"I'm coming,\" he said as he toddled along trying to run. \n",
      "Totto-chan realized that while Takahashi didn't drag his leg like Yasuaki-chan, who \n",
      "had had polio, he was taking the same amount of time to get to the tr ain. She quietly \n",
      "waited for him. Takahashi was running as fast as he could and ther e was no need to \n",
      "say, \"Hurry,\" for he was hurrying. His legs were very short and he was bow-legged. \n",
      "The teachers and grown-ups knew that he had stopped growing. When he saw t hat \n",
      "Totto-chan was watching him, he tried to hurry faster, swinging his arms, and when \n",
      "he got to the door, he said, \"You do run fast.\" Then he said, \"I'm fr om Osaka.\" \n",
      "\"Osaka!\" cried Totto-chan excitedly. Osaka was a dream city  she had never seen. \n",
      "Mother's younger brother--her uncle--was a university student, a nd whenever he \n",
      "came to the house he used to take her head in both his hands and lift her up as high as \n",
      "he could, saying, \"I'll show you Osaka. Can you see Osaka?\" \n",
      "It was just a game grown-ups used to play with children, but Tot to-chan believed \n",
      "him. It stretched the skin of her face horribly and pulled her ey es our of shape and \n",
      "hurt her ears, but she would frantically look into the distance to tr y and see Osaka. \n",
      "But she never could. She always believed, however, that one day she would be able \n",
      "to see it, so whenever her uncle came, she would ask, \"Show me Osa ka.\" So Osaka \n",
      "had become the city of her dreams. And Takahashi came from the re! \n",
      "\"Tell me about Osaka,\" she said to Takahashi. \n",
      "\"About Osaka?\" he asked, smiling happily. His voice was dear a nd mature. Just then \n",
      "the bell rang for the first class. \n",
      "\"What a pity,\" said Totto-chan. Takahashi went in gaily, swing ing the little body that \n",
      "was almost hidden by his bag, and sat down in the front row. Totto-ch an hurriedly sat \n",
      "down next to him. She was glad you could sit anywhere you liked. She didn't want to \n",
      "leave him. Thus, Takahashi became one of her friends, too. \n",
      "\"Look before You Leap!\"  \n",
      "On the way home from school, just as she had almost reached home, Tot to-chan \n",
      "discovered something enticing by the side of the road. It was a  huge pile of sand. \n",
      "How extraordinary to find sand there, so far from the sea! Was she dreaming! Totto-\n",
      "chan was thrilled. After a preliminary little hop she ran at gr eat speed toward the pile \n",
      "of sand and leaped onto its summit. But it wasn't sand after all! Inside, it was a heap \n",
      " 44  of prepared gray wall plaster. She sank into it with a \"blop\" and found herself \n",
      "covered in the gummy stuff right up to her chest, like a statue, c omplete with \n",
      "schoolbag and shoe bag. The more she snuggled to get our, the more her  feet slid \n",
      "about. Her shoes almost came off, and she had to be careful not to be come buried in \n",
      "it completely. So there was nothing she could do but stay still, wi th her left arm stuck \n",
      "in the gooey mixture holding onto her shoe bag. One or two women whom she  didn't \n",
      "know went by, and she said to them, \"Excuse me .. .\" in a small  voice, but they all \n",
      "thought she was playing and smiled and went on their way. \n",
      "As evening fell and it began to get dark, Mother came looking for he r and was \n",
      "astonished to find Totto-chan's head sticking out of the pile. She found a pole and \n",
      "had Totto-chan hold one end of it while she pulled her out. She had first t ried to pull \n",
      "her out by hand, but Mother's foot started to get stuck in the plaster . \n",
      "Totto-chan was covered with gray plaster just like a wall. \n",
      "\"I thought I told you once before,\" said Mother, \"when you see something that looks \n",
      "intriguing, don't jump on it straight away. Look before you leap!\" \n",
      "The \"once before\" that Mother was referring to happened during a l unch hour at \n",
      "school. Totto-chan was strolling along the little path behind the Ass embly Hall when \n",
      "she saw a newspaper lying in the middle of the path. Thinking it  would be fun to see \n",
      "if she could jump onto the newspaper, she took a few steps back, gave a little hop, \n",
      "and then, aiming for the center of the newspaper, ran toward it w ith tremendous \n",
      "speed and leaped onto it. But the newspaper had been left there by the janitor as a \n",
      "temporary covering for the cesspool opening mentioned before. He had gone away to \n",
      "do something and had laid the newspaper over the hole to keep the smell in because \n",
      "the concrete lid was off. Totto-chan fell right through and into the cesspool with a \n",
      "great big \"plop.\" It was really awful. But fortunately they m anaged to make a clean \n",
      "little girl of Totto-chan again. That was the time Mother wa s talking about. \n",
      "\"No, I won't jump on anything again,\" said Totto-chan, quietly. Mother  was relieved. \n",
      "But what Totto-chan said next made Mother think her relief was a  bit premature. \n",
      "\"I won't jump onto a newspaper or a pile of sand ever again.\" \n",
      "Mother was quite sure Totto-chan might easily take it into her hea d to lump onto \n",
      "something else. \n",

      "to give a little talk. \n",
      " 45  One day the headmaster said, \"I think we all ought to learn how t o speak better. What \n",
      "do you think? After this, while we are eating our lunch, let's have  somebody different \n",
      "each day stand in the middle of the circle and tell us about somet hing. How about \n",
      "that?\" \n",
      "Some children thought they weren't very good at speaking, but it woul d be fun to \n",

      "next day. \n",
      "Japanese children are usually taught at home not to talk at meal times. But as a result \n",
      "of his experience abroad, the headmaster used to encourage his pupils to take plenty \n",
      "of time over their meals and enjoy conversation. \n",
      "Besides that, he thought it was essential for them to learn how to get up in front of \n",
      "people and express their ideas clearly and freely without being em barrassed, so he \n",
      "decided it was time to put this theory into practice. \n",
      "After the children had agreed to the idea, this is what he told them . Totto-chan \n",
      "listened attentively. \n",
      "\"You needn't worry about trying to be a good speaker,\" he said. \"And you can talk \n",

      "over. \n",
      "The children soon discovered that unlike talking to two or three frie nds during lunch \n",
      "hour, standing up in the middle of the whole school needed a good deal of cour age \n",
      "and was quite difficult. Some children were so shy at first tha t they just giggled. One \n",

      "that boy just didn't. \n",
      " 46  The headmaster went over to the boy's desk with its empty lunchbox. \n",
      "\"So you have nothing to say,\" he said. \n",
      "\"Nothing.\" \n",
      "The boy wasn't trying to be clever, or anything like that. He honestly couldn't think \n",

      "What did you do after 'well?' \" \n",
      "\"Well,... uh ... I got up,\" he said, scratching his head some mor e. \n",
      "Totto-chan and the others were amused, but listened  attentively.  The  boy  went  on,  \n",
      "\"Then, uh...\" He scratched his head again. The head-master sat patiently watching the \n",
      "boy, with a smile on his face and his hands clasped on the desk. Then he  said, \"That's \n",
      "splendid. That will do. You got up this morning. You've made everyone unde rstand \n",
      "that. You don't have to be amusing or make people laugh to be a good s peaker. The \n",
      "important thing is that you said you hadn't anything to talk about and you did find \n",
      "something to say.” \n",
      "But the boy didn't sit down. He said in a very loud voice, \"And then. .. uh... \n",
      "All the children leaned forward. The boy took a deep breath and went  on, \"And \n",
      "then...uh... Mother...uh...she said, 'Brush your teeth'... uh...so I  brushed my teeth.\" \n",

      " 47  The headmaster clapped vigorously, and Totto-chan and the others did, too.  Even \n",
      "\"And then... uh...,\" who was still standing in their midst, clapped.  The Assembly Hall \n",
      "was filled with the sound of clapping. \n",
      "Even when he was a grown man that boy probably never forgot the sound of that \n",
      "applause. \n",
      "“We Were Only Playing!” \n",
      "Totto-chan had a terrible accident. It happened after she got home fr om school, while \n",

      "They had begun by playing a game where you rolled toward each other fr om \n",
      "opposite sides of the room, ending in a brief tussle when you bumped into e ach other. \n",
      "They played this several times and then decided to try something a little more \n",
      "complicated--although it was Totto-chan, of course, who did the decidin g. The idea \n",
      "was that when they met in the middle of the room after rolling t oward each other, the \n",
      "one who made the fiercer wolf face at the other would be the winner . Rocky was a \n",
      "German shepherd, so it wasn't hard for him to look like a wolf. A h he had to do was \n",
      "point his ears, open his mouth, and bare all his teeth. He could make hi s eyes look \n",
      "pretty fierce, too. It was a little more difficult for Tott o-chan. She would hold both \n",
      "hands up on either side of her head to look like ears, open her mouth and eye s as \n",
      "wide as she could, make growling noises, and pretend to bite Rocky.  At first, Rocky \n",
      "played the game very well. But he was a puppy, and after a whi le, he forgot it was \n",
      "just a game and suddenly bit Totto-chan in earnest. \n",
      "Although still a puppy, Rocky was almost twice as big as Totto -chan and had sharp, \n",
      "pointed teeth, so before she realized what was happening her right ear was dangling \n",
      "from her head and blood was streaming down. \n",
      "Hearing her screams, Mother came rushing from the kitchen to fi nd Totto-chan in the \n",
      "corner of the room with Rocky, holding her right ear with both hands. Her dress was \n",
      "splattered with blood. Daddy, who had been practicing the violin in the  living room, \n",
      "came rushing in, too. Rocky seemed to realize he had done something terrible. His \n",
      "tail hung between his legs and he looked pathetically at Totto-chan. \n",
      "The only thing Totto-chan could think of was what would she do if Mother a nd \n",
      "Daddy got so angry with Rocky they got rid of him or gave him aw ay. That would \n",
      "have been the saddest and most dreadful thing as far as she was c oncerned. So she \n",
      "crouched down beside Rocky, holding her right ear and crying out repea tedly, \"Don't \n",
      "scold Rocky! Don't scold Rocky!\" \n",
      "Mother and Daddy were more interested in seeing what had happened to her eat and \n",
      "tried to pull her hands away. Totto-chan wouldn't let go and shouted, \"it doesn't hurt! \n",
      "Don't be cross with Rocky! Don't be cross!\" Totto-chan truly was n't conscious of the \n",
      "pain at the time. All she could think of was Rocky. \n",
      "Blood kept trickling down, and Mother and Daddy eventually realized tha t Rocky \n",
      "must have bitten her. But they assured Totto-chan they wouldn't be cr oss with him, \n",
      "and the child finally removed her hands. When she saw Totto-chan's ear dangling, \n",
      "Mother screamed. Daddy carried his little girl to the doctor's  with Mother leading the \n",
      " 48  way. Luckily, because it was treated in time, the doctor was able to fasten the ear \n",
      "back, just as it was before, to her parents' great relief. But the only thing Totto-chan \n",
      "was  concerned  about,  however,  was whether Mother and Daddy woul d keep their \n",
      "promise not to scold Rocky. \n",
      "Totto-chan went home all bandaged from the top of her head to her chin, looki ng just \n",
      "like a white rabbit. In spite of his promise not to scold Rocky, Da ddy felt very \n",
      "inclined to admonish the dog in some way. But Mother gave him a look with her \n",
      "eyes as much as to say, \"Please keep your promise,\" and Daddy reluctantly did so. \n",
      "Totto-chan rushed into the house, anxious to let Rocky know, as soon as po ssible, \n",
      "that everything was all right, and nobody was cross any more. But  she couldn't find \n",
      "Rocky anywhere. For the first time Totto-chan cried. She hadn' t cried at the doctor's, \n",
      "she had been so afraid that if she did, it would increase her parent s' anger with the \n",
      "dog. But there was no stopping her tears now. As she cried, she called, “Rocky! \n",
      "Rocky! Where are you!\" \n",
      "After calling several more times, her tear-stained face lifted into a smile as a familiar \n",
      "brown back emerged slowly from behind the sofa. Going up to Totto-chan, he  gently \n",
      "licked the good ear that was just visible among the bandages. Totto- chan put her \n",
      "arms around Rocky's neck and sniffed inside his ears. Mother and Dadd y used to say \n",
      "they were smelly, but how she loved that dear familiar odor. \n",
      "Rocky and Totto-chan were tired and very sleepy. \n",
      "The end-of-summer moon looked down from above the garden on the little bandag ed \n",
      "girl and the dog who never wanted to play \"wolf' again. The two wer e even better \n",
      "friends now than they had been before. \n",
      "Sports Day \n",
      "Tomoe's Sports Day was held every year on the third of November. T he headmaster \n",
      "had decided on that day after a lot of research, in which he found out that the third of \n",
      "November was the autumn day on which it had rained the fewest times . Perhaps it \n",
      "was due to his skill in collecting weather data, or perhaps it was just that the sun and \n",
      "clouds heeded his desire--that no rain should mar the Sports Day so anti cipated by \n",
      "the children, who had decorated the school grounds the day before and made  all sorts \n",
      "of preparations. Whatever it was, it was almost uncanny the way  it never rained on \n",
      "that day. \n",
      "As all kinds of things were done differently at Tomoe, its Sports Day, too, was \n",
      "unique. The only sports events that were the same as at other ele mentary schools \n",
      "were the Tug of War and the Three Legged Race. All the rest had been invented by \n",
      "the headmaster. Requiring no special or elaborate equipment, they m ade use of \n",
      "familiar everyday school things. \n",
      "For instance, there was the Carp Race. Large tubular cloth str eamers, shaped and \n",
      "painted like carp-the kind that are flown from poles in May for Bo ys' Day Festival-- \n",
      "were laid in the middle of the school grounds. At the signal, the c hildren had to start \n",
      "running toward the carp streamers and crawl through them from the m outh end to the \n",
      "tail end and then run back to the starring point. There were only thre e carp one red \n",
      " 49  and two blue--so three children raced at a time. The race looked easy but was quite \n",
      "difficult. It was dark inside, and the carp were long, so you could easily lose your \n",
      "sense of direction. Some children, including Totto-chan, kept coming out o f the \n",
      "mouth, only to realize their mistake and hurriedly burrow inside again.  It was terribly \n",
      "funny to watch because the children crawling backward and forward ins ide made the \n",
      "carp wriggle as if they were alive. \n",
      "There was another event called Find-A-Mother Race. At the signal  the children had \n",
      "to run toward a wooden ladder propped up on its side, crawl through it be tween the \n",
      "rungs,  take  an envelope from a basket, open it, and if the paper inside said, for \n",
      "instance, \"Sakko-chan's mother,\" they would have to find her in the c rowd of \n",
      "spectators, take her hand, and return together to the finishing li ne. One had to ease \n",
      "oneself through the ladder with catlike grace or one's bottom could get stuck. Besides \n",
      "that, a child might know well enough who Sakko-chan's mother was, bur i f the paper \n",
      "read \"Miss Oku's sister,\" or Mr. Tsue's mother,\" or Mrs. K uninori's son,\" whom one \n",
      "had never met, one had to go to the spectators' section and call in a loud voice, \"Miss \n",
      "Oku's sister!\" \n",
      "It took courage. Children who were lucky and picked their own mothers would jump \n",
      "up and down shouting, \"Mother! Mother! Hurry!\" The spectators, too, had t o be alert \n",
      "for this event. There was no telling when their names might be c alled, and they \n",
      "would have to be ready to get up from the bench or from the mat where they were \n",
      "sitting, excuse themselves, and wend their way out as fast as  they could to where \n",
      "someone's child was waiting, take his or her hand, and go running off.  So when a \n",
      "child arrived and stopped in front of the grown-ups, even the fathers he ld their \n",
      "breath, wondering who was going to be called. There was little  time for idle chit-chat \n",
      "or nibbling food. The grown-ups had to take part in events almost as much as the \n",
      "children. \n",
      "The headmaster and other teachers joined the children in the two tea ms for the Tug \n",
      "of War, pulling and shouting, \"Heave-ho, heave-ho!\" while handicappe d children, \n",
      "like Yasuaki-chan, who couldn't pull, had the task of keeping their eye s on the hand-\n",
      "kerchief tied to the center of the rope to see who was winning. \n",
      "The final Relay Race involving the whole school was also different  at Tomoe. No \n",
      "one had to run over, far. All one had to do was run up and down the semicirc ular \n",
      "flight of concrete steps leading to the Assembly Hall. At fir st glance it looked \n",
      "absurdly easy, but the steps were unusually shallow and close toge ther, and as no one \n",
      "was allowed to take more than one step at a time, it was quite difficult if you were \n",
      "tall or had large feet. The familiar steps, bounded up each day at lunchtime, took on a \n",
      "fresh, fun aspect on Sports Day, and the children hurried up and down them \n",
      "shrieking gaily. To anyone watching from afar, the scene would have looked like a \n",
      "beautiful kaleidoscope. Counting the top one there were eight steps in all. \n",
      "The first Sports Day for Totto-chan and her classmates was a  fine day just as the \n",
      "headmaster had hoped. The decorations of paper chains and gold stars mad e by the \n",
      "children the day before and the phonograph records of rousing marches made it seem \n",
      "like a festival. \n",
      "Totto-chan wore navy blue shorts and a –white blouse, although she would ha ve \n",
      "preferred to wear athletic bloomers. She longed to wear them. One  day after school \n",
      " 50  the headmaster had been giving a class in eurythmics to some kinder garten teachers, \n",
      "and Totto-chan was very taken with the bloomers some of the women were  wearing. \n",
      "What she liked about them was that when the women stamped their fee t on the \n",
      "ground, their lower thighs showing beneath the bloomers rippled in such a lovely \n",
      "grown-up way. She ran home and got out her shorts and put them on and stam ped on \n",
      "the floor. But her thin, childish thighs didn't ripple at all. Afte r trying several times, \n",
      "she came to the conclusion it was because of what those ladies had been wearing. \n",
      "She asked what they were and Mother explained they were athletic bloomers. She \n",
      "told Mother she definitely wanted to wear bloomers on Sports Day, but they couldn't \n",
      "find any in a small size. That was why Totto-chan had to make do with shorts, which \n",
      "didn't produce any ripples, alas. \n",
      "Something amazing happened on Sports Day. Takahashi, who had the short est arms \n",
      "and legs and was the smallest in the school, came first in ever ything. It was \n",
      "unbelievable. While the others were still creeping about inside the carp, Takahashi \n",
      "was through it in a flash, and while the others only had their heads through the \n",
      "ladder, he was already out of it and running several yards ahead.  As for the Relay \n",
      "Race up the Assembly Hall steps, while the others were clumsi ly negotiating them a \n",
      "step at a time, Takahashi--his short legs moving like pistons -- was up them in one \n",
      "spurt and down again like a speeded-up movie. \n",
      "\"We've got to try and beat Takahashi,\" they all said.  \n",
      "Determined to beat him, the children did their utmost, but try as t hey might, \n",
      "Takahashi won every time. Totto-chan tried hard, too, but she never ma naged to beat \n",
      "Takahashi. They could outrun him in the straight stretches, but lost to him over the \n",
      "difficult bits. \n",
      "Takahashi went up to collect his prizes, looking happy and as proud as Punc h. He \n",
      "was first in everything so he collected prize after prize . Everyone watched enviously. \n",
      "\"I’ll beat Takahashi next year!\" said each child to himself. B ut every year it was \n",
      "Takahashi who turned out to be the star athlete. \n",
      "Now the prizes, too, were typical of the head-master. First P rize might be a giant \n",
      "radish; Second Prize, two burdock roots; Third Prize, a bundle of spinach.  Things \n",
      "like that. Until she was much older Totto-chan thought all schools ga ve vegetables \n",
      "for Sports Day prizes. \n",
      "In those days, most schools gave notebooks, pencils, and erasers for pr izes. The \n",
      "Tomoe children didn't know that, but they weren't happy about the vegeta bles. Totto-\n",
      "chan, for instance, who got some burdock roots and some onions, was embar rassed \n",
      "about having to carry them on the train. Additional prizes were given f or various \n",
      "things, so at the end of Sports Day all the children at Tomoe had s ome sort of \n",
      "vegetable. Now, why should children be embarrassed about going home fr om school \n",
      "with vegetables! No one minded being sent to buy vegetables by his mot her, but they \n",
      "apparently felt it would look odd carrying vegetables home from sc hool. \n",
      "A fat boy who won a cabbage didn't know what to do with it. \n",
      "\"I don't want to be seen carrying this,\" he said. \"I think I'l l throw it away.” \n",
      " 51  The headmaster must have heard about their complaints for he went over to the \n",
      "children with their carrots and radishes and things. \n",
      "\"What's the matter? Don't you want them?\" he asked. Then he went  on, \"Get your \n",
      "mothers to cool them for you for dinner tonight. They're vegetable you earned \n",
      "yourselves. You have provided food for your families by your own effor ts. How's \n",
      "that? I’ll bet it tastes good!\" \n",
      "Of course, he was right. It was the first time in her life , for instance, that Totto-chan \n",
      "had ever provided anything for dinner. \n",
      "\"I'll get Mother to make spicy burdock!\" she told the headmaster.  \"I haven't decided \n",
      "yet what to ask her to make with the onions.\" \n",
      "Whereupon the others all began thinking up menus, too, describing them to t he \n",
      "headmaster. \n",
      "\"Good! So now you've got the idea,\" he said, smiling so happily his che eks became \n",
      "quite flushed. He was probably thinking how nice it would be if the chil dren and \n",
      "their families ate the vegetables while talking over the Sports  Day events. \n",
      "No doubt he was thinking especially of Takahashi-whose dinner table would be \n",
      "overflowing with First Prizes-and hoping the boy would remember his pride and \n",
      "happiness at winning those First Prizes before developing an inferior ity complex \n",
      "about his size and the fact he would never grow. And maybe, who knows, the \n",
      "headmaster had thought up those singularly Tomoe-type events just so Takahashi \n",
      "would come first in them. \n",
      "The Poet Issa \n",
      "The children liked to call the headmaster \"Issa Kobayashi.\" The y even made up \n",
      "affectionate verses about him like the following: \n",
      "Issa Kobayashi! \n",
      "Issa's our Old Man \n",
      "With his bald head! \n",
      "That was because the headmaster's family name was Kobayashi, the same as that of \n",
      "the famous nineteenth-century poet Issa Kobayashi, whose haiku he loved. He \n",
      "quoted Issa's haiku so often, the children felt as if Issa Kobayashi  was just as much \n",
      "their friend as Sosaku Kobayashi, their headmaster. \n",
      "The headmaster loved Issa's haiku because they were so true and dea lt with the \n",
      "ordinary things in life. At a time when there must have been thousands  of haiku \n",
      "poets, Issa created a world of his own that nobody was able to imit ate. The \n",
      "headmaster admired his verses with their almost childlike simpli city. So at every \n",
      "opportunity, he would teach his pupils verses by Issa, which they would l earn by \n",
      "heart, such as: \n",
      "Lean Frog, \n",
      " 52  Don't you surrender! \n",
      "Here's Issa by you. \n",
      "Fledgling Sparrows! \n",

      "That day, as the train leaned over, creaking as usual as it we nt around the curve, \n",

      "picked up something once before that she thought was money but it turned out  to be \n",
      "a button, so she thought she had better have a good look this time. When t he train \n",
      "straightened out, she put her head right down and looked at it carefully.  It was \n",
      "definitely money--a five-sen coin. She thought somebody nearby must have dropped \n",
      "it and it had come rolling toward her when the train leaned over. But nobod y was \n",
      "standing anywhere near Totto-chan. \n",

      "Totto-chan couldn't smile back whole heartedly because she felt g uilty about what \n",

      "ground. While doing so, she thought our her plan. When she got off the trai n she \n",
      "would take the money and hand it to a policeman. Then another thought occurr ed to \n",
      "her. If any grown-ups saw her pick up the coin from under her foot, they  might think \n",
      "she was a thief! In those days you could buy a small packet of car amels or a bar of \n",
      "chocolate for five sen. So while if wouldn't seem like much of a s um to a grown-up, \n",
      "it was a large amount of money as far as Totto-chan was concer ned, and she became \n",
      "quite worried about it. \n",
      "\"That's it!\" she said to herself \"I’ll say quietly, “Oh, I' ve dropped some money. I \n",
      "must pick it up. Then everyone's bound to think it's mine!\" \n",
      "But immediately another problem occurred to her, \"What if I say t hat and everyone \n",
      "looks at me and someone says, “That's mine!' What will I do?\" \n",
      " 54  After turning over lots of ideas in her mind, she decided the best t hing to do would \n",
      "be to crouch down as the train neared her station, pretending to tie her shoelace, and \n",
      "pick up the money secretly. It worked. When she stepped onto the platfor m, damp \n",
      "with perspiration and clutching the five-sen piece, she felt exha usted. The police \n",
      "station was a long way off and if she went and handed in the money she  would get \n",

      "She climbed into a thicket near the station. Nobody could see her ther e, and no one \n",
      "was likely to climb in, so it seemed pretty safe. She dug a tiny hole with a stick, \n",
      "dropped the precious five-sen coin into it, and covered it with earth. S he found an \n",

      "\"I'll show you something lovely,\" she said to Rocky, removing the st one and digging \n",
      "carefully. But strangely enough, the five-sen coin had disappeared! S he had never \n",
      "been so surprised. Did someone see her hide it, she wondered, or had t he stone \n",
      "moved! She dug all around, but the five-sen piece Was nowhere to be found.  She was \n",
      "very disappointed not to be able to show it to her friends at Tomoe, but m ore than \n",
      "that she couldn't get over the mysteriousness of it. \n",
      "Thereafter, every time she passed by she would climb into the t hicket and dig, but \n",
      "never again did she see that five-sen piece. \n",
      "\"Perhaps a mole took it?\" she would think. Or, \"Did I dream it?\"  Or, \"Maybe God \n",

      "Like his name, meaning \"round hill,\" his head was completely round, w ithout a \n",
      "single hair on top, but with a fringe of white hair at the back at  ear level. He wore \n",
      "round glasses, and his cheeks were bright red. He not only looked quite different \n",
      "from Mr. Kobayashi, but he used to recite classical Chinese-sty le poems in a solemn \n",
      "voice. \n",
      "On the morning of December fourteenth, when the children were all assembled at \n",
      "school, Mr. Maruyama made the following announcement: \n",
      "\"This is the day, nearly two and a half centuries ago, that the F orty-seven Ronin \n",

      "avenge the honor of their dead master, who had been so grievously wronge d. Besides \n",

      "he declared, \"I, Rihei Amanoya, am a man\" and refused to confe ss or give away a \n",

      "When they got to Sengakuji, Mr. Maruyama gave each child a s tick of incense and a \n",

      "Ronin made Totto-chan feel very solemn as she offered the incense a nd the flowers, \n",
      "and she bowed silently, imitating· Mr. Maruyama. A hush fell upon the children. It \n",
      "was unusual for Tomoe pupils to be so quiet. The smoke from the incense  sticks \n",
      "placed before each tomb drifted up, drawing pictures in the sky for a long, long time. \n",
      "After that, the smell of incense always made the children t hink of Mr. Maruyama and \n",

      "“MaSOW-chaan!\" \n",
      "On her way to and from the station, Totto-chan used to pass a tenement  where some \n",
      "Koreans lived. Totto-chan, of course, didn't know they were Koreans. T he only thing \n",
      "she knew about them was that there was a woman there who wore her  hair parted \n",
      "down the middle and drawn back into a bun, and who was rather plump and wore \n",
      "white rubber shoes that were pointed in front like little boats. She  wore a dress with a \n",
      "long skirt and a ribbon tied in a big bow on the front of her short blouse, and always \n",
      "seemed to be looking for her son, calling out. \"MaSOW-chaan!\" She was always \n",
      "calling his name. And instead of pronouncing it \"Ma-sa-o-chan,\" as people normally \n",
      "would, she stressed the second syllable and drew out the \"chan\" in a  high-pitched \n",
      "voice that sounded sad to Totto-chan. \n",
      " 57  The tenement was right beside the Oimachi train necks on a smal l embankment. \n",
      "Totto-chan knew who Masao-chan was. He was a little bigger than s he was and \n",
      "probably in second grade, although she didn't know which school he went to. H e had \n",
      "untidy hair and always had a dog with him. One day, as Totto-c han was walking \n",
      "home post the embankment, Masao-chan was standing on top of it with his feet apart \n",
      "and his hands on his hips, in an arrogant posture. \n",
      "\"Korean!\" he shouted at Totto-chan. \n",
      "His voice was scathing and full of hatred. Totto-chan was scared. She had never done \n",
      "anything mean to him, or even spoken to him for that matter, so she was startled \n",
      "when he yelled at her from above in such a spiteful way. \n",
      "When she got home she told Mother about it. \"Masao-chan called me a K orean,\" she \n",
      "said. Mother put her hand to her mouth and Totto-chan saw her eyes fill  with mars. \n",
      "Totto-chan was perplexed, thinking it must be something very bad. Mother  didn't \n",
      "stop to wipe away her tears, and the tip of her nose was red. \"poor child!\" she said. \n",
      "\"People must call him 'Korean! Korean!' so ofmn that he thinks it's  a nasty word. He \n",
      "probably doesn't understand what it means because he's still young. H e thinks it's like \n",
      "baka , which people say when they mean 'you fool.' Masao-chan has probably  had \n",
      "'Korean' said to him so often he wanted to say something nasty to somebody else, so \n",
      "he called you a Korean. Why are people so cruel?” \n",
      "Drying her eye, Mother said to Totto-chan very slowly, \"You're  Japanese and Masao-\n",
      "chan comes from a country called Korea. But he's a child, just l ike you. So, Totto-\n",
      "chan dear, don't ever think of people as different. Don't think, 'That pe rson's a \n",
      "Japanese, or this person's a Korean.' Be nice to Masao-chan. It' s so sad that some \n",
      "people think other people aren't nice just because they're Koreans.\"  \n",
      "It was all rather difficult for Totto-chan to understand, but what she did understand \n",
      "was that Masao-chan was a little boy whom people spoke ill of for no reason at all. \n",
      "That must be why his mother was always searching for him s o anxiously, she \n",
      "thought. So next morning, as she passed the embankment and heard his mothe r \n",
      "calling out, \"MaSOW-chaan\" in her shrill voice, she wondered wher e he could be,  \n",
      "and made up her mind that even though she herself wasn't a Korean, i f Masao-chan \n",
      "called her that again, she would reply, \"We're all children! We 're all the same,\" and \n",
      "she'd try to make friends with him. \n",
      "Masao-chan's mother's voice, with its combination of irritation a nd anxiety, had a \n",
      "special quality of its own that seemed to linger in the air for a long time, until it was \n",
      "drowned by the sound of a passing train. \n",
      "\"MaSOW-chaan!\" \n",
      "Once you heard the sad, tearful sound of that voice you could never forge t it. \n",
      "Pigtails \n",
      "About that time, Totto-chan had two great ambitions. One was to wea r athletic \n",
      "bloomers, and the other was to braid her hair. Watching older school-gi rls with long \n",
      "braids in the train, she decided she wanted to wear her hair that w ay, too. While the \n",
      " 58  rest of the little girls in her class wore their hair shor t, with bangs, Totto-chan wore \n",
      "hers longer, parted at the side and tied with a ribbon. Mother liked it that way, and \n",
      "besides, Totto-chan wanted it to grow so she could wear pigtails. \n",
      "Finally, one day she got Mother to braid her hair into two little  pigtails. With the \n",
      "ends secured by rubber bands and tied with slender ribbons, she felt li ke an older \n",
      "student. When she looked at herself in the mirror, she realized tha t, unlike the girls in \n",
      "the train, her braids were thin and short and really looked like pigs'  tails, but she ran \n",
      "to Rocky and held them up proudly for him to see. Rocky blinked once or t wice. \n",
      "\"I wish I could braid your hair, too,\" she said. \n",
      "When she got on the train she held her head as still as she could for  fear the braids \n",
      "might come undone. \"How nice it would be,\" she thought, \"if someone notic ed them \n",
      "on the train and said, 'What lovely braids!' \" But nobody did. When she got to school,  \n",
      "however, Miyo-chan, Sakko-chan, and Keiko Aoki, who were all in her cl ass, \n",
      "exclaimed in unison, \"Oooh! Pigtails!\" and she was awfully pleased and let the girls \n",
      "feel them. \n",
      "None of the boys seemed impressed. But all of a sudden, after lunc h, a boy from her \n",
      "class named Oe said in a loud voice, “Wow! Totto-chan's got a new  hairdo!\" \n",
      "Totto-chan was thrilled to think one of the boys had noticed, and said pr oudly, \n",
      "\"They're pigtails.\" \n",
      "Whereupon he came over, took hold of them with both hands, and said, \"I'm tir ed. I \n",
      "think I'll hang onto them for a while. Gee, they're much nicer tha n the hand snaps on \n",
      "the train!\" But that wasn't the end of her trouble. \n",
      "Oe was twice as big as skinny little Totto-chan. In face, he was the biggest and fattest \n",
      "boy in the class. So when he pulled on her pigtails she staggered and fell smack on \n",
      "her bottom. To have them called hand scraps was hurtful enough, without be ing \n",
      "dragged to the ground as well. But when Oe tried to pull her up by her  pigtails, with \n",
      "a \"Heave-ho, heave-ho!\" just like at the Sports Day Tug of War , Totto-chan burst \n",
      "into tears. \n",
      "To Totto-chan, pigtails were the emblem of an older girl. She ha d expected everyone \n",
      "to be very polite to her because of them. Crying, she ran to the  headmaster's office. \n",
      "When he heard her knocking on the door, sobbing, he opened it, and bent down as \n",
      "usual so their faces were level. \n",
      "\"What's the matter?\" he asked. \n",
      "After checking to see if her pigtails were still properly  braided, she said, \"Oe pulled \n",
      "them, saying, 'Heave-ho, heave-ho.' \" \n",
      "The headmaster looked at her hair. In contrast to her tearful fac e, her little pigtails \n",
      "looked as if they were dancing gaily. He sat down and had Totto-chan sit down, too, \n",
      "facing him. As usual, heedless of his missing teeth, he grinned.  \n",
      "\"Don't cry,\" he said. \"Your hair looks lovely. \n",
      " 59  \"Do you like it?\" she asked, rather shyly, raising her tear- stained face. \n",
      "\"It's terrific!\" he said. \n",
      "Totto-chan stopped crying, and got down from her chair saying, “I won’ t cry any \n",
      "more even if Oe says 'Heave-ho.' \" \n",
      "The headmaster nodded approval with a grin. \n",
      "Totto-chan smiled, too. Her smiling face suited her pigtails. Bowing to the \n",
      "headmaster, she ran back and began playing with the other children. \n",
      "She had almost forgotten about having cried when she saw Oe standing  in front of \n",
      "her, scratching his head. \n",
      "\"I'm sorry I pulled them,\" he said in a loud, flat voice. \"I've been scolded by the \n",
      "headmaster. He said you've got to be nice to girls. He said to be gentle with girls and \n",
      "look after them.\" \n",
      "Totto-chan was somewhat amazed. She had never heard anyone before sa y you had \n",
      "to be nice to girls. Boys were always the important ones. In t he families she knew \n",
      "where there were lots of children,-it was always the boys who were served first at \n",
      "meals and at snack time, and when girls spoke, their mothers would s ay, \"Little girls \n",
      "should be seen and not heard.\" \n",
      "In spite of all that, the headmaster had told Oe that girls shoul d be looked after. It \n",

      "and everything else you had to do to grow things in a field, explaini ng as he \n",

      "aroused. \n",
      "Grateful to be released at last from the difficult phrase, T otto-chan gave Mother all \n",

      "the following Friday morning. The things they had to bring were a s oup bowl, a rice \n",
      "bowl, chopsticks, and one cup of uncooked rice. The headmaster said it be came two \n",

      "The next few days Totto-chan stuck close to Mother in the kitchen and carefully \n",
      "observed how she used a knife, how she held a pot, and how she served the ri ce. It \n",
      "was nice watching her work in the kitchen, bur what Totto-chan liked most was the \n",

      "\"That's because earlobes are cold,\" Mother explained. \n",

      "do that, too!\" \n",
      "Friday finally arrived. When they had reached Thunder Canyon afte r leaving the \n",
      "train, the head-master surveyed the children gathered in the woods. Their dear little \n",
      "faces glowed in the sunlight as it filtered through the tall tre es. With their knapsacks \n",
      "bulging, the children waited to hear what the head-master had to say, while beyond \n",
      "them the famous waterfall fell in booming torrents, making a bea utiful rhythm. \n",
      " 69  \"Now then,\" said the headmaster, \"first of all, let's divide i nto groups and make \n",
      "stoves with the bricks the teachers have brought. Then some of you ca n wash the rice \n",
      "in the stream and put it on to cook. After that, we'll start maki ng the pork soup. Now \n",
      "then, shall we get started?\" \n",
      "The children divided themselves into groups by playing \"stone, paper,  scissors.\" \n",
      "Since there were only about fifty of them, it wasn't long befo re they had six groups. \n",
      "Holes were dug and surrounded with piled-up bricks. Then they laid thin ir on bars \n",
      "across to support the soup and rice pots. While that was going on, some gathered \n",
      "firewood in the forest, and others went off to wash the rice in the stream. The \n",
      "children themselves allotted their various tasks. Totto-chan offered to cut up the \n",
      "vegetables and take charge of the pork soup. A boy two years senior to Totto-chan \n",
      "was also assigned to chopping vegetables, but he cut them into pieces that were \n",
      "either too big or too small and made a mess of the job. He labore d manfully with the \n",
      "task, however, his nose glistening with perspiration. Totto-chan follow ed Mother's \n",
      "example and skillfully cut up the egg-plants, potatoes, onions, burdock roots , and so \n",
      "forth, that the children had brought, in just the right bite-sized pi eces. She even took \n",
      "it upon herself to make some pickles by slicing egg plant and cucumbe r very thin and \n",
      "rubbing the slices with salt. She gave advice, too, to some of the older children who \n",
      "were having trouble with their chores. Totto-chan really felt a s if she had already \n",
      "become a mother! Everyone was impressed with her pickles. \n",
      "\"Oh, I just thought I'd try and see if I could make some,\" she dec lared modestly. \n",
      "When it came to flavoring the pork broth, everyone was asked for an opinion. From \n",
      "the various groups came startled cries of, \"Wow!\" \"Gee!\" and a great deal of \n",
      "laughter. The birds in the forest twittered, too, joining in the g eneral uproar. In the \n",
      "meantime, tempting aromas rose from every pot. Until then, hardl y any of the \n",
      "children had ever watched something cooking or had to regulate the hea t. They had \n",
      "merely eaten what was put before them on the table. The joy o f cooking something \n",
      "themselves, with its attendant traumas--and seeing the  various  changes  the  \n",
      "ingredients  have  to undergo--was a whole new experience to them.  \n",
      "Eventually, the work at each group's makeshift stove was complete d. The headmaster \n",
      "had the children make a space on the grass where they could all si t in a circle. One \n",
      "soup pot and one rice pot were placed in front of each group. But Totto-chan refused \n",
      "to have her group's soup pot taken away until she had first performed the  action she \n",
      "had set her heart upon. Taking off the hot lid, she declared rather self-consciously, \n",
      "\"Ooh, that's hot!\" and put the fingers of both hands to her earlobes. Only then did she \n",
      "say, \"You can take it now,\" and the pot was duly carried over to w here the children \n",
      "were sitting, wondering what on earth was going on. No one seemed at all impressed. \n",
      "But Totto-chan was satisfied all the same. \n",
      "Everyone's attention was fixed on the bowls of rice in front of them and the contents \n",
      "of the steaming soup bowls. The children were hungry. But first a nd foremost, it was \n",
      "a meal they had made themselves! \n",
      "After the children had sung, \"Chew, chew, chew it  well,  Everyt hing  you  eat,\"  and  \n",
      "had  said,  \"I gratefully partake,\" all became quiet in the w oods. \n",
      "There was no sound but that of the waterfall. \n",
      " 70  “You're Really a Good Girl” \n",
      "“You're really a good girl, you know.” \n",
      "That's what the headmaster used to say every time he saw Tott o-chan. And every \n",
      "time he said it, Totto-chan would smile, give a little skip, and say, \"Yes, I am a good \n",
      "girl.\" And she believed it. \n",
      "Totto-chan was, indeed, a good girl in many ways. She was kind to e veryone -\n",
      "particularly her physically handicapped friends. She would defend them,  and, if \n",
      "children from other schools said cruel things, she would fight the torm entors, even if \n",
      "it ended with her crying. She would do everything to care for any i njured animals she \n",
      "found. But at the same time her teachers were continually astoni shed at the amount \n",
      "of trouble she always got into as she tried to satisfy her curios ity whenever she \n",
      "discovered anything unusual. \n",
      "She would do things like making her pigtails stick out behind under each ar m while \n",
      "marching to morning assembly. Once, when it was her turn to swe ep the classroom, \n",
      "she opened a trapdoor her sharp eyes had noticed in the floor and put all t he \n",
      "sweepings down the hole. It had originally been for inspecting the  machinery when it \n",
      "was a real train. But she couldn't get the trapdoor closed again, and caused everyone \n",
      "a lot of trouble. And then there was the time someone told her how m eat was hung \n",
      "up on hooks, so she went and hung by one arm from the highest exercise bar. She \n",
      "hung there for ages, and when a teacher saw her and asked what she w as doing, she \n",
      "shouted, \"I'm a piece of meat today!\" and just then lost her hold and fell down so \n",
      "hard it knocked all the wind out of her lungs and she couldn't speak all da y. Then, of \n",
      "course, there was that time when she jumped into the cesspool. \n",
      "She was always doing things like that and hurting herself, but the  headmaster never \n",
      "sent for Mother and Daddy. It was the same with the other childr en. Matters were \n",
      "always settled between the headmaster and the child concerned. lus t as he had \n",
      "listened to Totto-chan for four hours the day she first arrived at t he school, he always \n",
      "listened to what a child had to say about an incident caused. He even listened to their \n",
      "excuses. And if the child had done something really bad and eventually recognized it \n",
      "was wrong, the headmaster would say, \"Now apologize.\" \n",
      "In Totto-chan's case, complaints and fears voiced by children's pa rents and other \n",
      "teachers undoubtedly reached the ears of the headmaster. That's w hy, whenever he \n",
      "had a chance, he would say to Totto-chan, \"You're really a good gi rl, you know.  A \n",
      "grown-up, hearing him say it, would have realized the significanc e of the way he \n",
      "emphasized the word “really.” \n",
      "What the headmaster must have wanted to make  Totto-chan understand w as \n",
      "something like this: \"Some people may think you're not a good girl in m any respects, \n",
      "but your real character is not bad. It has a great deal that is good about it, and I am \n",
      "well aware of that.\" Alas, it was many, many years befor e Totto-chan realized what \n",
      "he really meant. Still, while she may not have grasped his t rue meaning at the time, \n",
      "the headmaster certainly instilled, deep in her, a confidence in he rself as “a good \n",
      "girl.” His words echoed in her heart even when she was engaged i n some escapade. \n",
      "And many times she said to herself, \"Good heavens!\" as she ref lected on something \n",
      "she had done. \n",
      " 71  Mr. Kobayashi kept on repeating, the entire time she was at Tom oe, those important \n",

      "His Bride \n",
      "Totto-chan was very sad. \n",
      "She was in third grade now and she liked Tai-chan a lot. He was c lever and good at \n",
      "physics. He studied English, and it was he who taught her the E nglish word for fox. \n",
      "\"Totto-chan,\" he had Said, \"do yoU know what the English word for kitsune  is? It's \n",
      "'fox.' \" \n",
      "\"Fox.\" \n",
      "Totto-chan had luxuriated in the sound of that word all day long. After t hat, the first \n",
      "thing she always did when she got to the classroom-in-the train was  to sharpen all the \n",
      "pencils in Tai-chan's pencil box as beautifully as she could wit h her penknife. She \n",
      "didn't bother about her own, which she just hacked at with her teeth. \n",

      " 72  There was a jingle--a sort of singsong refrain—that was popular  among elementary \n",

      "Whether a school was shabby or splendid in the first line depended on wh ether the \n",
      "building was old or new. The important part of the chant was the second line. The \n",

      "said your school was shabby on the outside. It was what it was like  inside that \n",

      "was putting it in a drawer and she gave it to me. Auntie said I was very observant.” \n",
      "\"I see,\" said the headmaster, deep in thought. \n",
      "Totto-chan was very proud of the ribbon. She told him how she had Bone to se e her \n",
      "aunt and was lucky to find her aunt airing some clothes. Among them was the old-\n",
      "fashioned, long, purple pleated skirt she had worn when she was a s choolgirl. As her \n",
      "aunt was putting it away, Totto-chan noticed something pretty on it. \n",
      "\"What's that?\" \n",
      "At Totto-chan's question, her aunt paused. The something pretty turned out to be this \n",
      "ribbon that was attached to the waistband at the back. \n",
      "\"It was supposed to make you look pretty from the back,\" said Auntie.  \"In those days \n",
      "everyone wanted to put a piece of handmade lace there or a wide ribbon tied in a big \n",
      "bow. \n",
      "She noticed how longingly Totto-chan gazed at the bow as she listened,  stroking it \n",
      "and feeling it, and said, \"I’ll give it to you. I shan't be we aring it again.\" \n",
      "She took some scissors and cut the thread attaching it to the skirt  and gave it to \n",
      "Totto-chan. That was how she got it. It really was a beautiful  ribbon. It was wide and \n",
      "of very good silk, and had roses and all sorts of designs woven into it.  Wide and stiff \n",
      "when it was tied, if made a bow as big as Totto-chan's head. A untie said the fabric \n",
      "was imported. \n",
      "While she was speaking, Totto-chan jiggled her head occasionally s o the headmaster \n",
      "could hear the rustling sound the ribbon made. When he had heard her story , the \n",
      "headmaster looked a little distressed. \n",
      "\"So that's it,\" he said. \"Yesterday Miyo-chan said she wanted a  ribbon just like yours, \n",
      "so I went to all the ribbon shops in Jiyugaoka, but they didn't have an ything like it. \n",
      "So that's it. It's imported, is it?\" \n",
      " 75  His face was more like that of a troubled father importuned by hi s daughter than of a \n",
      "headmaster. \n",
      "\"Totto-chan, I'd be truly grateful if you'd stop wearing that ri bbon to school. You see, \n",
      "Miyo-chan keeps pestering me about it. Would you mind very much?\" \n",
      "Totto-chan thought it over, her arms folded. Then she answered quickly, “All right. I \n",
      "won't wear it here any more.\" \n",
      "\"Thank you,\" said the headmaster. \n",
      "Totto-chan was rather sorry, but the headmaster was in trouble, s o she had agreed. \n",
      "Another reason was that the thought of a grown-up man--her beloved head master-\n",
      "searching high and low in all the ribbon shops, made her feel sorry f or him. That was \n",
      "the way it was at Tomoe. Without realizing it, everyone got i n the habit of \n",
      "understanding one another's problems and trying to help, irrespective of age. It \n",
      "became the natural thing to do. \n",
      "The following morning, when Mother went into Totto-chan's room to clea n up after \n",
      "Totto-chan had left for school, she found the ribbon tied around the neck of Tot to-\n",
      "chan's favorite teddy bear. She wondered why Totto-chan had suddenly given up \n",
      "wearing the ribbon she had been so thrilled about. Mother thought the gra y teddy \n",
      "bear looked slightly embarrassed about being dressed so gaily all of a sudden. \n",
      "Visiting the Wounded \n",
      "For the first time in her life Totto-chan visited a hospital for  wounded soldiers. She \n",
      "went with about thirty elementary school children from various schools,  children she \n",
      "didn't know. It was part of a scheme recently organized nationally  for groups of \n",
      "elementary school children. Each school would normally send two or thre e children, \n",
      "but small schools like Tomoe only sent one, and the group would be in the char ge of \n",
      "a teacher from one of the schools. Totto-chan was representing Tomo e. \n",
      "The teacher in charge was a thin woman who wore glasses. She l ed the children into \n",
      "a ward where there were about fifteen soldiers in white pajamas , some in bed and \n",
      "others walking about. Totto-chan had worried about what wounded soldiers w ould \n",
      "look like, but they all smiled and waved their hands and seemed cheerf ul so she was \n",
      "relieved, although some had bandages on their heads. \n",
      "The teacher assembled the children in the middle of the ward and a ddressed the \n",
      "soldiers. \n",
      "\"We've come to visit you,\" she said, and the children all bowed. The  teacher went on, \n",
      "\"Since to-day is the fifth of May-boy's Day-we're going to sing  'Carp Streamers.' \" \n",
      "She raised her arms, like a conductor, said to the children, \"Now,  ready! Three, four,\" \n",
      "and began to beat time. The children didn't know each other but they all  began \n",
      "singing whole heartedly: \n",
      "Over the sea of rooftops, \n",
      "    Over the sea of clouds ...  \n",
      " 76  Totto-chan didn't know the song. They didn't teach that sort of song at  Tomoe. She \n",
      "sat on the edge of the bed of a man with a kind face who was sit ting up, and just \n",
      "listened to them singing, feeling rather awkward. When that s ong was over, the \n",
      "teacher announced very clearly, \"Now we shall sing 'The Doll Fe stival.' \" They sang \n",
      "it beautifully. All except Totto-chan. \n",
      "Come let us light the lanterns, \n",
      "Light them one by one...  \n",
      "There was nothing Totto-chan could do but remain silent. \n",
      "When they had all finished singing, the men clapped. The teacher s miled and said, \n",
      "\"Now then, what about 'The pony and the Mare'! All together. Three,  four,\" and \n",
      "started beating time again. \n",
      "Totto-chan didn't know that one either. When the children had finished sing ing it, the \n",
      "soldier in the bed Totto-chan was sitting on paned her head and said, \"Y ou didn't \n",
      "sing.\" \n",
      "Totto-chan felt very apologetic. She had come to visit the soldiers  and she couldn't \n",
      "even sing them a single song. So she got up, and, standing a little away from the bed, \n",
      "said bravely, \"All right. Now I’ll sing one I know. \n",
      "Something was about to happen that wasn't according to plan. \n",
      "\"What are you going to sing!\" asked the teacher. \n",
      "But Totto-chan had already taken a deep breath and was startin g to sing, so she \n",
      "decided to wait. \n",
      "Since she was representing Tomoe, Totto-chan thought she had better sing Tomoe's \n",
      "best-known song. After taking that deep breath, she began: \n",
      "Chew, chew, chew it well, \n",
      "Everything you eat...  \n",
      "Some of the children laughed. Others asked their neighbors, \"What's  the song! \n",
      "What's the song!\" The teacher started to beat time, but nor knowing  quite what to do, \n",
      "was left with arms in midair. Totto-chan was embarrassed, but she sang for all she \n",
      "was worth: \n",
      "Chew it and chew it and chew it and chew it, \n",
      "Your rice and fish and meat!  \n",
      "When she finished singing, Totto-chan bowed. When she raised her hea d, she was \n",
      "astonished to see tears streaming down the face of the soldier. She thought she must \n",
      "have done something bad. And then the soldier, who looked a little older t han Daddy, \n",
      "patted her head again, and said, \"Thank you! Thank you!\" \n",
      " 77  He went on patting her head, and he couldn't stop crying. Then the teacher said \n",
      "brightly, as if to try and cheer him up, \"Now I think it's time  to read out the \n",
      "compositions we've written for the soldiers.\" \n",
      "The children took turns reading their compositions aloud. Totto-chan looked at  her \n",
      "soldier. His nose and eyes were led, but he smiled. Totto-chan s miled back. And she \n",
      "thought to herself, \"I'm so glad the soldier smiled!\" \n",
      "What had brought tears to that soldier's eyes, only the soldier knew. Maybe he had a \n",
      "little girl like Totto-chan. Or maybe he was simply touched by the sweet way she \n",
      "sang that song as best she could. Or maybe because of his expe rience at the war \n",
      "front, he knew how near they all were to starvation, and the thought of this little girl \n",
      "singing \"Chew it well\" when there might soon be nothing left to che w may have \n",
      "filled him with sadness. The soldier may also have realized wha t terrible events \n",
      "would soon engulf these very children. \n",
      "The children, reading their compositions, may not have sensed it then,  but the Pacific \n",
      "War was already well underway. \n",
      "Health Bark \n",
      "Showing her train pass on the cord around her neck to the man at the ga te--whom she \n",
      "now knew quite well-Totto-chan walked out of the station at Jiyugaoka. \n",
      "Something very interesting was going on. A young man was sitting cross-legged on a \n",
      "mat behind an enormous pile of what looked like pieces of tree bark. Fiv e or six \n",
      "people stood around looking down at him. Totto-chan decided to join them, since the \n",
      "man was saying, \"Now watch me carefully, watch me careful ly. When the man saw \n",
      "Totto-chan stop, he said, \"The most important thing for you is health.  When you get \n",
      "up in the morning and want to know whether you are well or not, this piece  of balk \n",
      "will tell you. Ever, morning all you have to do is chew a bit of t his bark. If it tastes \n",
      "bitter, it proves you are not well. If it doesn't taste bitter , you know you're all right. \n",
      "You're not ill. This bark that tells you whether you're ill or not  only costs twenty sen! \n",
      "Will that gentleman over there care to try a piece!\" \n",
      "He handed the bark to a rather thin man, who timidly bit it with his  front teeth. The \n",
      "man tilted his head slightly and considered it. \n",
      "\"It does seem... a tiny bit... uh.., bitter.\" \n",
      "The young man leaped up, exclaiming, \"Sir, you must be suffering  from some \n",
      "disease. You'll have to be careful. But don't worry, it's not ve ry serious yet. You said \n",
      "it just seemed a little bitter. Now what about the lady over there. Would you mind \n",
      "chewing this, please!\" A woman with a shopping basket took a larger piece of bark \n",
      "and chewed it vigorously. She announced cheerfully, \"Why, that wasn't  bitter at all!\" \n",
      "\"Congratulations, madam,\" said the man. \"You must be very healthy , indeed.\" Then \n",
      "he said, raising his voice, “Only twenty sen! Twenty sen! Tha t's all it costs to find \n",
      "out every morning whether you are healthy or not. A real bargain! \" \n",
      "Totto-chan wanted to try a bite of the grayish bark, too, but was t oo shy to ask. \n",
      "Instead, she asked, \"Will you still be here when school's over?\" \n",
      " 78  \"Sure,\" said the man, glancing at the young school child. \n",
      "Totto-chan ran off, her bag flapping against her back. She didn't  want to be late since \n",
      "there was something she had to do before school began. She had to ask the children \n",
      "something the moment she got to her classroom. \n",
      "\"Can anybody lend me twenty sen?\" \n",
      "But nobody had twenty sen. One of those long packers of caramels only  cost ten sen, \n",
      "so it wasn't very much money, really, but nobody had it. \n",
      "\"Shall I ask my parents?\" asked Miyo-chan. \n",
      "At times like these it was very convenient that Miyo-chan happene d to be the \n",
      "daughter of the head-master. Miyo-chan's house adjoined-the Assembly  Hall, so it \n",
      "was just as if her mother lived at the school. \n",
      "\"Daddy says he'll lend it to you,\" she told Totto-chan at lunchtime,  \"but he wants to \n",
      "know what it's for.\" \n",
      "Totto-chan made her way to the office. \n",
      "\"So you want twenty sen,\" he said, taking off his glasses. \"What  do you want it for?\" \n",
      "\"I want to buy a piece of bark that tells you whether you're si ck or whether you’re \n",
      "well,\" she replied quickly. The headmaster's curiosity was a roused. \n",
      "\"Where are they selling them?\" \n",
      "\"In front of the station,\" she replied, in a great hurry. \n",
      "\"All right,\" said the headmaster. \"Buy one if you want. But l et me have a bite, won't \n",
      "you?\" \n",
      "He took a purse out of his jacket pocket and placed twenty sen in Totto -chan's palm. \n",
      "\"Oh, thank you so much!\" said Totto-chan. \"I'll get the money from M other and pay \n",
      "you back. She always gives me money for books. If I want to buy an ything else I \n",
      "have to ask first, but health bark is something everybody needs so I 'm sure she won't \n",
      "mind.\" \n",
      "When school was over, Totto-chan hurried to the station, clutching her t wenty sen. \n",
      "The man was still there, extolling his product in a loud patter. W hen he saw the \n",
      "twenty sen in Totto-chan's hand, he broke into a broad grin. \n",
      "\"Good girl! Your mother and father will be pleased.\" \n",
      "\"So will Rocky,\" said Totto-chan. \n",
      "\"Who's Rocky?' asked the man, as he picked out a piece of bark fo r Totto-chan. \n",
      "\"He's our dog. He's a German shepherd.\" \n",
      " 79  The man stopped and thought for a minute, then said, \"A dog ... well,  I suppose it'll \n",
      "work with a dog, too. After all, if it's bitter he won't li ke it and that'll mean he's ill.\" \n",
      "The man picked out a piece of bark about one inch wide and six inches long.  \n",
      "\"Here you are. Bite some every morning and if it's bitter, y ou're sick. If not, you're as \n",
      "fit as a fiddle!\" \n",
      "Totto-chan went home carefully carrying the precious bark wrapped in new spaper. \n",
      "The first thing she did when she got there was to take a small bi te. It was dry and \n",
      "rough, but not bitter. In fact it didn't taste of anything at all . \n",
      "\"Hooray! I'm healthy!\" \n",
      "\"Of course you are,\" said Mother, smiling. \"What on earth's the  matter?\" \n",
      "Totto-chan explained. Mother tried biting a piece of the bark, too. \n",
      "“It's not bitter.” \n",
      "\"Then you're healthy, too, Mother!\" \n",
      "Then Totto-chan went over to Rocky and held the bark to his mouth. First Rocky \n",
      "sniffed it. Then he licked it. \n",
      "\"You've got to bite it,\" said Totto-chan. \"Then you'll know whether  you're sick or \n",
      "not.\" \n",
      "But Rocky made no attempt to bite it. He just scratched the bac k of his ear with his \n",
      "paw. Totto-chan held the tree bark closer to his mouth. \n",
      "\"Come on, bite it! It would be terrible if you weren't well.\" \n",
      "Rocky reluctantly bit a tiny piece off the edge. Then he sniffe d it again, but he didn't \n",
      "look as if he particularly disliked it. He just let out a big ya wn. \n",
      "\"Hooray! Rocky's healthy, too!\" \n",
      "Next morning, Mother gave Totto-chan twenty sen. She went straig ht to the \n",
      "headmaster's office and thrust out the tree bark. \n",
      "For a moment the headmaster looked at it as if to say, \"What's  this!\" Then he saw the \n",
      "twenty sen Totto-chan had brought him, clutched carefully in her hand, a nd \n",
      "remembered. \n",
      "\"Bite it,\" said Totto-chan. \"If it's bitter, it means you' re ill.\" \n",
      "The headmaster bit some. Then he turned the bark over and studied it c arefully. \n",
      "\"Does- it taste bitter?\" asked Totto-chan, concerned, looking at the  headmaster's face. \n",
      "“It hasn't any taste at all.\" \n",
      " 80  As he returned the bark to Totto-chan, he said, \"I'm fine. Thank you.” \n",
      "\"Hooray! The headmaster's healthy! I'm so glad.\" \n",
      "That day Totto-chan got everybody in the school to bite a piece of bark.  Not a single \n",
      "child found it bitter, which meant they were all healthy. Totto- chan was very glad. \n",
      "The children all went and told the headmaster they were healthy , and to each child \n",
      "the headmaster replied, \"That's good.\" \n",
      "The headmaster must have known all along. He was born and bred in the heart of the \n",
      "country in Gumma Prefecture, beside a river from which you could see  Mount \n",
      "Haruna. He must have known that the bark would not taste bitter, no mat ter who \n",
      "chewed it. \n",
      "But the headmaster thought it was nice for Totto-chan to be so glad to find that \n",
      "everyone was healthy. He was happy that Totto-chan had been brought up to be the \n",
      "kind of person who would have been worried and concerned about anyone who \n",
      "might have said the bark tasted bitter. \n",
      "Totto-chan even tried pushing the tree bark into the mouth of a stray dog walking \n",
      "near the school. She almost got bitten, but that didn't daunt her. \n",
      "\"You'll know whether you're sick or not,\" she shouted at the dog. \" Come on, bite it! \n",
      "'Cause if you're healthy, then that's fine.\" \n",
      "She succeeded in getting that dog she didn't know to bite a piece. S kipping around \n",
      "the dog she cried, \n",
      "\"Hooray! You're healthy, too!\" \n",
      "The dog bowed its head, as if thanking her, and ran off. \n",
      "Just as the headmaster guessed, the bark-seller never showed up i n Jiyugaoka again. \n",
      "Even, morning, before she left for school, Totto-chan took the precious pie ce of bark \n",
      "from her drawer--it now looked as if an energetic beaver had been at  it--and chewed \n",
      "some of it, calling out as she left the house, \"I'm healthy!\"  \n",
      "And, thankfully, Totto-chan was in fact healthy. \n",
      "The English-speaking Child  \n",
      "A new pupil arrived at Tomoe. He was tall for an elementary s chool boy, and~ \n",
      "broad. Totto-chan thought he looked more like a seventh grader. His cl othes were \n",
      "different, too, more like grown-up ones. \n",
      "That morning in the school grounds the head-master introduced the new s tudent. \n",
      "\"This is Miyazaki. He was born and brought up in America, so he doe sn't speak \n",
      "Japanese very well. That's why he has come to Tomoe, where he  will be able to make \n",
      " 81  friends more easily and take his time over his studies. He's one of you now. What \n",
      "grade \n",
      "shall we put him in! What about fifth grade, with Ta-chan and the ot hers!\" \n",
      "\"That's fine,\" said Ta-chan - who was good at drawing--in a big-brot herly voice. \n",
      "The headmaster smiled and went on, \"I said he wasn't very good at J apanese, but he's \n",
      "very good at English. Get him to teach you some. He's not used to l ife in Japan, \n",
      "though, so you'll help him, won't you? And ask him about life in America . He'll be \n",
      "able to tell you all sorts of interesting things. Well, then, I’ll leave him with you.\" \n",
      "Miyazaki bowed to his classmates, who were all much smaller t han he was. And all \n",
      "the children, not only the children in Ta-chan's class, bowed back. \n",
      "At lunchtime Miyazaki went over to the head-master's house, and all  the others \n",
      "followed him. Then what did he do but start to walk into the house with his  shoes on! \n",
      "All the children shouted at him, \"You've got to take off your shoes?\"  \n",
      "Miyazaki seemed startled. \"Oh, excuse me,\" he said, taking  them off. \n",
      "The children began telling him what to do, all talking at once. \n",
      "\"You have to take your shoes off for rooms with tatami-matted fl oors and for the \n",
      "Assembly Hall. You can keep them on in the classrooms and in the libr ary. \n",
      "\"When you go to Kuhonbutsu Temple you can keep them on in the courtyard but you \n",
      "have to take them off in the temple.\" \n",
      "It was fun learning about the differences between living in Japan and living abroad. \n",
      "Next day Miyazaki brought a big English picture book to school. They all clustered \n",
      "around him at lunchtime to look at the book. They were amazed. They had never \n",
      "seen such a beautiful picture book More. The picture books they knew wer e only \n",
      "printed in bright reds, greens, and yellows, but this one had pale fle sh-colored pinks. \n",
      "As for the blues, they were lovely shades, mixed with white and gr ay--colors that \n",
      "didn't exist in crayons. There were lots of colors besides the s tandard twenty-four in a \n",
      "box of crayons, colors that were not even in Ta-chan's special box of forty-eight. \n",
      "Everyone was impressed. As for the pictures, the first one was of a dog pulling a \n",
      "baby by its diaper. What impressed them was that the baby didn't  look as if it was \n",
      "painted but had soft pink skin just like a teal baby. They had never s een a picture \n",
      "book that was so big and printed on such lovely, thick, shiny paper. In her  usual \n",
      "sociable way, Totto-chan got as close to Miyazaki and the picture  book as she could.. \n",
      "Miyazaki read the English text to them. The English language sounde d so smooth \n",
      "that they listened enraptured. Then Miyazaki began to grapple with Japanese. \n",
      "Miyazaki certainly had brought something new and different to the school. \n",
      "\"Akachan  is baby,\" he began. \n",
      "They all repeated it after him. “ Akachan  is baby.” \n",
      " 82  \"UtsukuSHII  is beautiful,\" Miyazaki said next, stressing the \" ku .\" \n",
      "\"UuukuSHII  is beautiful,\" repeated the others. \n",
      "Miyazaki then realized his Japanese pronunciation had been wrong. \"It 's utsukuSHII , \n",
      "is it? Right?\" \n",
      "Miyazaki and the other children soon became good friends. Every day he brought \n",
      "various books to Tomoe and read them to the others at lunchtime. \n",
      "It was just as if Miyazaki was their English tutor. At the  same time Miyazaki's \n",
      "Japanese quickly improved. And he stopped making blunders like sitting in the \n",
      "tokonama , the alcove reserved for hanging-scrolls and ornaments. \n",
      "Totto-chan and her friends learned lots of things about America. J apan and America \n",
      "were becoming friends at Tomoe. But outside Tomoe, America ha d become an \n",
      "enemy, and since English had become an enemy language, it was dropp ed from the \n",

      "Before they could begin rehearsing, the children had to learn their  lines. It was nice \n",
      "for Totto-chan and the monks, for they had nothing to say. All that the monks were \n",

      "She kicked Aiko Saisho in the legs and scratched her. Aiko cried and the  monks \n",

      "wrong. He shouldn't have let Totto-chan have a monk's long staff. T otto-chan got \n",

      "So eventually she was deprived of her role as a monk, too. \n",
      "Tai-chan as Yoshitsune, gritted his teeth manfully as he was kno cked over and \n",

      "because they had ample opportunity for doing it at school. \n",
      "During music periods in the Assembly Hall, the headmaster would g ive each child a \n",
      "piece of white chalk. They could lie or sit anywhere they liked on the floor and wait, \n",
      "chalk in hand. When they were all ready, the headmaster started playing the piano. \n",
      "As he did so, they would write the rhythms, in musical notation, on t he floor. It was \n",
      "lovely writing in chalk on the shiny light brown wood. There were only about ten \n",
      "pupils in Totto-chan's class, so when they were spread around the lar ge Assembly \n",
      "Hall, they had plenty of floor on which to write their notes as l arge as they wanted \n",
      "without encroaching on anyone else's space. They didn't need lines for  their notation, \n",
      "since they just wrote down the rhythm. At Tomoe musical notes had s pecial names \n",
      "the children devised themselves after talking it over with the he admaster. Here they \n",
      "are: \n",
      "(musical symbol) was called a skip, because it was a good rhyt hm to skip and jump \n",
      "to. \n",
      "(musical symbol)was called a flag, because it looked like one. \n",

      "(musical symbol) was called a black. \n",
      "(musical symbol) was called a white \n",
      "(musical symbol) was called a white-with-a-mole, or a white 'n' dot. \n",
      "(musical symbol) was called a circle. \n",
      "This way they learned to know the notes well and it was fun. It was a class they \n",
      "loved. \n",
      "Writing on the floor with chalk was the head-master's idea. Pap er wasn't big enough \n",
      "and there weren't enough blackboards to go around. He thought the Assem bly Hall \n",
      "floor would make a nice big blackboard on which the children could note the rhythm \n",
      "with ease no matter how fast the music was, and writing as l arge as they liked, \n",
      "Above all, they could enjoy the music. And if there was time af terward, they could \n",
      "draw airplanes and dolls and anything they wanted. Sometimes the c hildren would \n",
      " 85  join up their drawings just for fun and the whole floor would become one e normous \n",
      "picture. \n",
      "At intervals during the music class, the headmaster would come ove r and inspect \n",
      "each child's rhythms. He would comment, \"That's good,\" or \"it was n't a flag-flag \n",
      "there, it was a skip.\" \n",
      "After he had approved or corrected their notation, he played the music over again so \n",
      "they could check what they had done and familiarize themselves wit h the rhythms. \n",
      "No matter how busy he was, the head-master never let anyone e lse take these classes \n",
      "for him. And as far as the children were concerned, it wouldn't have  been any fun at \n",
      "all without Mr. Kobayashi. \n",
      "Cleaning up after writing rhythms was quite a job. First you had to wipe the floor \n",
      "with a blackboard eraser, and then everyone joined forces to make the floor spick and \n",
      "span again with mops and rags. It was an enormous task. \n",
      "In this way Tomoe children learned what trouble cleaning off graf fiti could be, so \n",
      "they never scribbled anywhere except on the floor of the Assembly H all. Moreover, \n",
      "this class took place about twice a week, so the children had their  fill of scribbling. \n",
      "The children at Tomoe became real experts on chalk--which kind was best, how to \n",
      "hold it, how to manipulate it for the best results, how not to break it . Every one of \n",
      "them was a chalk connoisseur.  \n",
      "\"Yasuaki-chan's Dead\" \n",
      "It was the first morning of school after the spring vacation. Mr. Kobayashi stood in \n",
      "front of the children assembled on the school grounds, his hands in his pockets as \n",
      "usual. But he didn't say anything for some time. Then he took his ha nds out of his \n",
      "pockets and looked at the children. He looked as if he had been crying. \n",
      "\"Yasuaki-chan's dead,\" he said slowly. \"We're all going to hi s funeral today.\" Then \n",
      "he went on, \"You all liked Yasuaki-chan, I know. It's a great shame . I feel terribly \n",
      "sad.\" He only got that far when his face became bright red and te ars welled up in his \n",
      "eyes. The children were stunned and nobody said a word. They were all  thinking \n",
      "about Yasuaki-chan. Never had such a sad quietness passed over the grounds of \n",
      "Tomoe before. \n",
      "\"Imagine dying so soon,\" thought Totto-chan. \"I haven't even finished Uncle Tom's \n",

      "She remembered how crooked his fingers had looked when she and Yasuaki-chan \n",
      "said goodbye before spring vacation and he handed her the book. She recalle d the \n",
      "first time she met him, when she had asked, \"Why do you walk like  that?\" and his \n",
      "soft reply, \"I had polio\" She thought of the sound of his voice and his lit tle smile. \n",
      "And that summer tree-climbing adventure of just the two of them. She  remembered \n",
      "with nostalgia how heavy his body had been, and the way he had truste d her \n",
      "implicitly even though he was older and taller. It was Yasuaki- chan who told her \n",
      "they had something in America called television. Totto-chan loved Ya suaki-chan. \n",
      "They had lunch together, spent their breaks together, and walked to t he station \n",
      " 86  together after school. She would miss him so much. Totto-chan realiz ed that death \n",
      "meant Yasuaki-chan would never come to school any more. It was like  those baby \n",
      "chicks. When they died, no matter how she called to them they never  moved again. \n",
      "Yasuaki-chan's funeral took place at a church on the opposite side of Denenchofu \n",
      "from where he lived. \n",
      "The children walked there in silence from Jiyugaoka, in single f ile. Totto-chan didn't \n",
      "look around her as she usually did but kept her eyes on the ground the whole t ime. \n",
      "She realized she now felt differently from when the headmaster had told them the sad \n",
      "news. Her first reaction was disbelief, and then came sadness.  But now all she \n",
      "wanted was to see Yasuaki-chan alive just once more. She wanted t o talk to him so \n",
      "much she could hardly bear it. \n",
      "The church was filled with white lilies. Yasuaki-chan's pretty  mother and sister and \n",
      "relatives, all dressed in black, were standing outside the church.  When they saw \n",
      "Totto-chan they cried even more, their white handkerchiefs in their  hands. It was the \n",
      "first rime Totto-chan had been to a funeral, and she realized how  sad it was. Nobody \n",
      "talked, and the organ played soft hymn music. The sun was shining and t he church \n",
      "was full of light, but there was no happiness in it anywhere. A  man with a black arm-\n",
      "band handed a single white flower to each of the Tomoe children and expl ained that \n",
      "they were to walk one after the other and place their flower in Y asuaki-chan's coffin. \n",
      "Yasuaki-chan lay in the coffin with his eyes closed, surrounded by flowers. Although \n",
      "he was dead, he looked as kind and clever as ever. Totto-chan knelt and pla ced her \n",
      "flower by his hand and gently touched it--the beloved hand she had held so  often. His \n",
      "hand was so much whiter than her grubby little hand and his fingers so m uch longer, \n",
      "like a grown-ups. \n",
      "\"Bye now,\" she whispered to Yasuaki-chan. \"Maybe we'll meet aga in somewhere \n",
      "when we're much older. And maybe your polio will be cured by then.\" \n",
      "Then Totto-chan got up and looked at Yasuaki-chan once more. \"Oh yes, I forg ot,\" \n",
      "she said, \"Uncle Tom's Cabin. I shan't be able to return it t o you now, shall I? I'll \n",
      "keep it for you, until we meet next time.\" \n",
      "As she started walking away, she was sure she heard his voice behind her, \"Totto-\n",
      "chan, we had a lot of fun together, didn't we? I'II never forget you. Never.” \n",
      "When Totto-chan reached the entrance, she turned around. I’ll never fo rget you \n",
      "either,\" she said. \n",
      "The spring sunshine shone softly just as it had on the day she first met Yasuaki-chan \n",
      "in the classroom-in-the-train. But unlike that day, her cheeks were  wet with tears. \n",
      "A Spy \n",
      "The children at Tomoe were sad for a long time, thinking about Yasu aki-chan, \n",
      "particularly so in the morning, when it was time to start clas s. It took a while for the \n",
      "children to get used to the fact that Yasuaki was not just late, but wasn't ever coming \n",
      "again. Small classes might be nice, but at times like this it  made things much harder. \n",
      "Yasuaki-chan's absence was so conspicuous. The only saving grace was the fact that \n",
      " 87  seats were not assigned. If he had had a regular desk, its being vacant would have \n",
      "been awful. \n",
      "Recently Totto-chan had begun to think about what she would like to be when s he \n",
      "grew up. When she was younger she thought she wanted to be a street  musician or a \n",
      "ballerina, and the day she first arrived at Tomoe she thought it would be nice to be a \n",
      "ticket seller at a station. But now she thought she would like to do some kind of work \n",
      "that was unusual but a little more feminine. It might be rather ni ce to be a nurse, she \n",
      "thought. But she suddenly remembered that when she had visited the wounded \n",
      "soldiers in the hospital she had noticed nurses doing things like giving  injections, and \n",
      "that might be rather difficult. So what should she do! Suddenly she wa s transported \n",
      "with joy. \n",
      "\"Why, of course! I've already decided what 1 am going to be!\"  \n",
      "She went over to Tai-chan, who had just lit his alcohol burner. \n",
      "\"I'm thinking of becoming a spy,\" she said proudly. \n",
      "Tai-chan turned away from the flame and looked at Totto-chan's fa ce for some time. \n",
      "Then he gazed out of the window for a while, as if he were thinking i t over, before \n",
      "turning to Totto-chan again to say in his intelligent, resonant voice, slowly and \n",
      "simply, so she would understand, \"You have to be clever to be a spy.  Besides that, \n",
      "you've got to know a lot of languages.\" \n",
      "Tai-chan paused a moment for breath. Then he looked straight at her  and said \n",
      "bluntly, \"In the first place, a lady spy has to be beautiful.\"  \n",
      "Totto-chan slowly lowered her eyes from Tai-chan's gaze and hung her head. After a \n",
      "pause, Tai-chan said thoughtfully in a low voice, this time without looking at Totto-\n",
      "chan, \"And-besides, I don't think a chatterbox could be a spy.” \n",
      "Totto-chan was dumbfounded. Not because he was against her being a spy . But \n",
      "because everything Tai-chan said was true. They were all thi ngs she had suspected. \n",
      "She realized then that in every respect she lacked the talents  a spy needed. She knew, \n",
      "of course, that Tai-chan had not said those things out of spite. There  was nothing to \n",
      "do but give up the idea. It was just as well she had talked it over  with him. \n",
      "\"Goodness me,\" she thought to herself, \"Tai-chan's the same ag e as I am and yet he \n",
      "knows so much more.\" \n",
      "Supposing Tai-chan told her he was thinking of being a physicist. What  on earth \n",
      "would she be able to say in reply? \n",
      "She might say, \"Well, you're good at lighting alcohol burners w ith a match.\" But that \n",
      "would sound too childish. \n",
      "\"Well, you know that kitsune  is 'fox' in English and kutsu  are 'shoes,' so I think you \n",
      "could be a physicist.\" No, that wasn't good enough, either. \n",
      "In any event, she was quite sure Tai-chan was destined to do somet hing brilliant. So \n",
      "she just said sweetly to Tai-chan, who was watching the bubbles for m in his flask, \n",
      " 88  “Thank you. I shan't be a spy, then. But I'm sure you will become  somebody \n",
      "important.\" \n",
      "Tai-chan mumbled something, scratched his head, and buried himself in t he book \n",
      "that lay open before him. \n",
      "If she couldn't be a spy, then what could she be, wondered Totto-cha n, as she stood \n",

      "Daddy's Violin \n",
      "Before they knew it, the war with all its horrors was beginni ng to make itself felt in \n",
      "the life of Totto-chan and her family. Every day men and boys f rom the \n",
      "neighborhood were sent off with waving flags and shouts of \"Banzai!\" F oodstuffs \n",
      "rapidly disappeared one after the other from the shops. It became harder to comply \n",
      "with the Tomoe lunchtime rule of \"something from the ocean and something  from \n",
      "the hills.\" Mother was making do with seaweed and pickled plums, but s oon even \n",
      "that became difficult to get. Just about everything was rationed. There were no \n",
      "sweets to be found, no matter how hard you searched. \n",
      "Totto-chan knew about a vending machine under the stairs at Ookayama, the station \n",
      "before hers, where you could get a packer of caramels if you put  money in the slot. \n",
      "There was a very appetizing picture on top of the machine. You could get a small \n",
      "packet for five sen and a big one for ten. But the machine had been e mpty for a long \n",
      "time now. Nothing would come out no matter how much money you put in or how \n",
      "hard you banged. Totto-chan was more persistent than most. \n",
      "\"Maybe there's still one packet in there some where,\" she thoug ht. \"Maybe it's caught \n",

      "So every day she got off the train at the stop before hers and tr ied putting five- and \n",
      "ten-sen coins into the machine. But all she got back was her money.  It fell out with a \n",
      "clatter. \n",
      "About that time, someone told Daddy what most people would have thought \n",
      "welcome news. If he went and played popular wartime music on his violin at \n",
      "something called a munitions factory—where they made weapons and other  things \n",
      "used in war—he would be given sugar and rice and other treats. Sinc e Daddy, who \n",
      "had recently been awarded a prestigious musical decoration, was w ell known as a \n",
      "violinist, the friend told him he would certainly be given a lot of e xtra presents. \n",
      "\"What do you think?\" Mother asked Daddy. \"Are you going to do it?\" \n",
      "Concerts were certainly becoming scarce. In the first place , more and more \n",
      "musicians were being called up and the orchestra was short of play ers. Radio \n",
      "broadcasts were almost entirely given over to programs connected w ith the war, so \n",
      "there was not much work for Daddy and his colleagues. He ought to have welcomed \n",
      "the opportunity to play anything. \n",
      "Daddy thought for some time before replying. \"I don't want to play  that sort of thing \n",
      "on my violin.\" \n",
      " 89  \"I think you're right,\" said Mother. \"I would refuse. We’ll get  food somehow.\" \n",
      "Daddy knew Totto-chan had barely enough to eat and was vainly putting mone y in \n",
      "the caramel vending machine every day. He also knew that the gi fts of food he would \n",
      "receive for playing a few wartime tunes would be very handy for  his family. But \n",
      "Daddy valued his music even more. Mother knew that, too, and so she neve r urged \n",
      "him to do it. \"Forgive me, Totsky!\" said Daddy, sadly. \n",
      "Totto-chan was too young to know about art and ideology and work. But she did \n",
      "know that Daddy loved the violin so much he had been something called \"disow ned,\" \n",
      "and many of his family and relatives did not speak to him any more . He had had a \n",
      "hard time, but he had refused to give up the violin all the same. So T otto-chan \n",
      "thought it quite right for him not to play something he didn't like. Totto-chan skipped \n",
      "about around Daddy and said cheerfully, \"I don't mind. Because I love y our violin, \n",
      "too.\" \n",
      "But the next day Totto-chan again got off at Ookayama and peered into the hole in \n",

      "give up their position. So if you were the least bit slow, you'd f ind the headmaster's \n",
      "back very crowded. But this time Totto-chan made up her mind to be ther e first and \n",
      "was already waiting in the middle of the Assembly Hall when the headmaster \n",
      "arrived. As he approached, she shouted to him, \"Sir, I've got som ething to tell you.” \n",
      "\"What is it, then?\" asked the headmaster delightedly, as he s at down on the floor and \n",
      "started to cross his legs. \n",
      "Totto-chan wanted to tell him what she had decided after several da ys' thought. \n",
      "When the headmaster had crossed his legs, Totto-chan suddenly decided a gainst \n",
      "climbing on his back. What she had to say would be more appropriate sai d face to \n",
      "face. So she sat down very close to him, facing him, and tilted her head a little with a \n",
      "smile that Mother had called her \"nice face\" ever since she wa s small. It was her \n",
      "\"Sunday best\" face. She felt confident when she smiled like that,  her mouth slightly \n",
      "open, and she herself believed she was a good girl. \n",
      " 90  The headmaster looked at her expectantly. \"What is it?\" he asked again, leaning \n",
      "forward. \n",
      "Totto-chan said sweetly and slowly, in a big-sisterly or motherl y way, \"I'd like to \n",
      "teach at this school when I grow up. I really would.\" \n",
      "Totto-chan expected the headmaster to smile, but instead, he asked i n all seriousness, \n",
      "\"Promise?\" \n",
      "He really seemed to want her to do it. \n",
      "Totto-chan nodded her head vigorously and said, \"I promise,\" determining  in her \n",
      "heart to become a teacher there without fail. \n",
      "At that moment she was thinking about the morning when she first ca me to Tomoe as \n",
      "a first grader and met the headmaster in his office. It seem ed a long time ago. He had \n",
      "listened patiently to her for four hours. She thought of the warmth in hi s voice when \n",
      "he had said to her, after she had finished talking, \"Now you're a pupil of this school.\" \n",
      "She loved Mr. Kobayashi even more than she had then. And she was determi ned to \n",
      "work for him and do anything she could to help him. \n",
      "When she had promised, he smiled delightedly—as usual, showing no \n",
      "embarrassment about his missing teeth. Totto-chan held out her litt le finger. The \n",
      "headmaster did the same. His little finger looked strong--you could put your faith in \n",
      "it. Totto-chan and the headmaster then made a pledge in the time-hono red Japanese \n",
      "way by linking little fingers. The headmaster was smiling. T otto-chan smiled, too, \n",
      "reassured. She was going to be a teacher at Tomoe! What a wonderf ul thought. \n",
      "\"When I'm a teacher ... ,\" she mused. And these were the thing s that Totto-chan \n",
      "imagined: not too much study; lots of Sports Days, field kitchens, c amping, and \n",
      "walks! \n",
      "The headmaster was delighted. It was hard to imagine Totto-cha n grown-up, but he \n",
      "was sure she could be a Tomoe teacher. He thought the Tomoe children w ould all \n",
      "make good teachers since they were likely to remember what it was like being a \n",
      "child. \n",
      "There at Tomoe, the headmaster and one of his pupils  were  making  a  solemn  \n",
      "promise  about something that lay ten years or more in the future,  when everyone \n",
      "was saying it was only a matter of time before American airplanes loaded with \n",
      "bombs appeared in the skies over Japan. \n",
      "Rocky Disappears \n",
      "Lots of soldiers had died, food had become scarce, everyone was living  in fear--but \n",
      "summer came as usual. And the sun shone on the nations that were winnin g as well \n",
      "as on the nations that weren't. \n",
      "Totto-chan had just returned to Tokyo from her uncle's house in Kamakura . \n",
      "There was no camping now at Tomoe and no more lovely visits to hot spr ing resorts. \n",
      "It seemed as if the children would never be able to enjoy a summe r vacation as happy \n",
      " 91  as that one. Totto-chan always spent the summer with her cousins at  their house in \n",
      "Kamakura, but this year it had been different. An older boy, a rel ative who used to \n",
      "tell them scary ghost stories, had been called up and had gone to the  war. So there \n",
      "were no more ghost stories. And her uncle who used to tell them such i nteresting \n",
      "tales  about his life in America--they never knew whether they were true or not--was \n",
      "at the front. His name was Shuji Taguchi, and he was a top-ranki ng cameraman. \n",
      "After serving as bureau chief of Nihon News in New York and as Far  East \n",
      "representative of American Metro-News, he was better known as S hu Taguchi. He \n",
      "was Daddy's elder brother, though Daddy had taken his mother's fam ily name in \n",
      "order to perpetuate it. Otherwise Daddy's surname would have been T aguchi, too. \n",
      "Films Uncle Shuji had shot, such as \"The Battle of Rabaul,\" wer e being shown at \n",
      "movie theaters, but all he sent from the front were his films, so Totto-chan's aunt and \n",
      "cousins were worried about him. War photographers always showed the troops in \n",
      "dangerous positions, so they had to be ahead of the troops to show them advanc ing. \n",
      "That was whet Totto-chan's grown-up relatives had been saying. \n",
      "Even the beach at Kamakura somehow seemed forlorn that summer. Ya t-chan was \n",
      "funny, though, in spite of it all. He was Uncle Shuji's eldest  son. Yat-chan was about \n",
      "a year younger than Totto-chan. The children all slept together under  one large \n",
      "mosquito net, and before he went to sleep, Yat-chan used to shout \"Long Live the \n",
      "Emperor!\" then fall like a soldier who had been shot and pretend to be d ead. He \n",
      "would do it over and over again. The funny thing was that whenever he did this, he \n",
      "invariably walked in his sleep and fell off the porch causing a great fuss. \n",
      "Totto-chan's mother had stayed in Tokyo with Daddy, who had work to do.  Now that \n",
      "summer vacation was over, Totto-chan had been brought back to Tokyo by t he sister \n",
      "of the boy who used to tell ghost stories. \n",
      "As usual on arriving at home, the first thing Totto-chan did was look for Rocky. But \n",
      "he was nowhere to be found. He wasn't in the house and he wasn't i n the garden. Nor \n",
      "was he in the greenhouse where Daddy grew orchids. Totto-chan was worried, since \n",
      "Rocky normally came out to meet her long before she even reached the house. Totto-\n",
      "chan went out of the house and down the road, calling his name, but there  was no \n",
      "sign of those beloved eyes, ears, or tail. Totto-chan thought he mig ht have gone back \n",
      "while she was out looking for him, so she hurriedly ran home to see. B ut he wasn't \n",
      "there. \n",
      "\"Where's Rocky?\" she asked Mother. \n",
      "Mother must have known Totto-chan was running everywhere looking for Rocky , \n",
      "but she didn't say a word. \n",
      "\"Where's Rocky?\" Totto-chan asked again, pulling Mother's skirt. \n",
      "Mother seemed to find it difficult to reply. \"He disappeared,\" she  said. \n",
      "Totto-chan refused to believe it. How could he have disappeared? \"When? \" she \n",
      "asked, looking Mother in the face. \n",
      " 92  Mother seemed at a loss for words. \"just after you left for K amakura,\" she began, \n",
      "sadly. Then she hurriedly continued, \"We looked for him. We went every where. And \n",
      "we asked everybody. But we couldn't find him. I've been wondering how  to tell you. \n",
      "I'm terribly sorry. Then the truth dawned on Totto-chan. Rocky must  have died. \n",
      "\"Mother doesn't want me to be sad,\" she thought, \"but Rocky's dead.\" \n",
      "It was quite clear to Totto-chan. Up till now, no matter how long T otto-chan was \n",
      "gone, Rocky never went far from the house. He always knew she woul d come back. \n",
      "\"Rocky would never go off like that without telling me,\" she thought  to herself. It \n",
      "was a strong conviction. \n",
      "But Totto-chan did not discuss it with Mother. She knew how Mother must f eel. \"I \n",
      "wonder where he went,\" was all she said, keeping her eyes lower ed. \n",
      "It was all she could do to say that much, and then she ran upstairs to her room. \n",
      "Without Rocky, the house didn't seem like their house at all. When s he got to her \n",
      "room, she tried hard not to cry and thought about it once more. She wonder ed \n",
      "whether she had done anything mean to Rocky—anything that would mak e him want \n",
      "to leave. \n",
      "\"Never tease animals,\" Mr. Kobayashi always told the childre n at Tomoe. \"it's cruel \n",
      "to betray animals when they trust you. Don't make a dog beg and the n not give it \n",
      "anything. The dog won't trust you any more and might develop a bad nature.\" \n",
      "Totto-chan always obeyed these rules. She had never deceived Rocky.  She had done \n",
      "nothing wrong that she could think of. \n",
      "Just then Totto-chan noticed something clinging to the leg of her teddy  bear on the \n",
      "floor. She had managed not to cry until then, but when she saw it she bu rst into tears. \n",
      "It was a little tuft of Rocky's light brown hair. It must have  come off when the two of \n",
      "them had rolled about on the floor, playing, the morning she left for Kamakura. With \n",
      "those few little German shepherd hairs clutched in her hand, she cr ied and cried. Her \n",
      "tears and her sobbing just wouldn't stop. \n",
      "First Yasuaki-chan and now Rocky. Totto-chan had lost another friend. \n",
      "The Tea Party \n",
      "Ryo-chan, the janitor at Tomoe, whom all the children liked so much, was finally \n",
      "called up. He was a grown-up, but they all called him by his chil dish nickname. Ryo-\n",
      "chan was a sort of guardian angel who always came to the rescu e and helped when \n",
      "anyone was in trouble. Ryo-chan could do anything. He never said muc h, and only \n",
      "smiled, but he always knew just what to do. When Totto-chan fell int o the cesspool, \n",
      "it was Ryo-chan who came to her rescue straight away, and washe d her off without \n",
      "so much as a grumble. \n",
      "\"Let's give Ryo-chan a rousing, send-off tea party,\" said the headmaster. \n",
      "\"A tea party?\" \n",
      "Green tea is drunk many times during the day in Japan, but it is not  associated with \n",
      "entertaining--except ceremonial powdered tea, a different beve rage altogether. A \"tea \n",
      " 93  party\" would be something new at Tomoe. But the children liked the idea . They \n",
      "loved doing things they'd never done before. The children didn't know it, but  the \n",
      "headmaster had invented a new weld, sawakai  (tea party), instead of the usual \n",
      "sobetsukai  (farewell party), on purpose. A farewell party sounded too sad, and the \n",
      "older children would understand that it might really be farewell i f Ryo-chan got \n",
      "killed and didn't come back. But nobody had ever been to a tea parry befo re, so they \n",
      "were all excited. \n",
      "After school, Mr. Kobayashi had the children arrange the desks in a circle in the \n",
      "Assembly Hall just as at lunchtime. When they were all sitt ing in a circle, he gave \n",
      "each one a single thin strip of roasted dried squid to have with thei r green tea. Even \n",
      "that was a great luxury in those wartime days. Then he sat down next to Ryo-chan \n",
      "and placed a glass before him with a little sake in it. It wa s a ration obtainable only \n",
      "for those leaving for the front. \n",
      "\"This is the first tea party at Tomoe,\" said the headmaster . \"Let’s all have a good \n",
      "time. If there's anything you'd like to say to Ryo-chan, do s o. You can say things to \n",
      "each other, too, not just to Ryo-chan. One by one, standing in the middl e.\" \n",
      "It was not only the first time they had ever eaten dried squid at Tomoe, but the first \n",
      "time Ryo-chan had sat down with them, and the first time they had seen Ryo-chan \n",
      "sipping sake. \n",
      "One after the other the children stood up, facing Ryo-chan, and spoke  to him. The \n",
      "first children just told him to take care of himself and not get si ck. Then Migita, who \n",
      "was in Totto-chan's class, said, \"Next time I go home to the  country I'll bring you all \n",
      "back some funeral dumplings.\" \n",
      "Everyone laughed. It was well over a year since Migita fir st told them about the \n",
      "dumplings he had once had at a funeral and how good they were. Whenever the  \n",
      "opportunity arose, he promised to bring them some, but he never did it. \n",
      "When the headmaster heard Migita mention funeral dumplings, it gave  him quite a \n",
      "start. Normally it would have been considered bad luck to mention funeral  dumplings \n",
      "at such a time. But Migita said it so innocently, just wanting to share with his friends \n",
      "something that tasted so good, that the head-master laughed with t he others. Ryo-\n",
      "chan laughed heartily, too. After all, Migita had been tell ing him for ages that he \n",
      "would bring him some. \n",
      "Then Oe got up and promised Ryo-chan that he was going to become the be st \n",
      "horticulturist in Japan. \n",
      "Oe was the son of the proprietor of an enormous nursery garden in Todorok i. Keiko \n",
      "Aoki got up next and said nothing. She just giggled shyly, as usual, and bowed, and \n",
      "went back to her seat. Whereupon Totto-chan rushed forward and said for he r, \"The \n",
      "chickens at Keiko-chan's can fly! I saw them the other day!\" \n",
      "Then Amadera spoke. \"If you find any injured cats or dogs,\" he said, \"bring them to \n",
      "me and I’ll fix them up. \n",
      " 94  Takahashi was so small he crawled under his desk to get to the ce nter of the circle \n",
      "and was there as quick as a wink. He said in a cheerful voice, \"T hank you Ryo-chan. \n",
      "Thank you forever thing. For all sorts of things.\" \n",
      "Aiko Saisho stood up next. She said, \"Ryo-chan, thank you for bandaging m e up that \n",
      "time I fell down. I’ll never forget.\" Aiko Saisho's great-uncl e was the famous \n",
      "Admiral Togo of the Russo-Japanes War, and Atsuko Saisho, another rela tive of \n",
      "hers, was a celebrated poetess at Emperor Meiji's court. But  Aiko never mentioned \n",
      "them. \n",
      "Miyo-chan, the headmaster's daughter, knew Ryo-chan the best. Her eyes were full \n",
      "of tears. \"Take care of yourself, won't you, Ryo-chan. Le t's write to each other. \n",
      "Totto-chan had so many things she wanted to say she didn't know where t o begin. So \n",
      "she just said, \"Even though you're gone, Ryo-chan, we'll have a tea  party every day.” \n",
      "The headmaster laughed, and so did Ryo-chan. All the children laughed, t oo, even \n",
      "Totto-chan herself. \n",
      "But Totto-chan's words came true the very next day. Whenever t here was time the \n",
      "children would form a group and play \"tea party.\" Instead of dried squid, they would \n",
      "suck things like tree bark, and they sipped glasses of water inst ead of tea, sometimes \n",
      "pretending it was sake. Someone would say, “I’ll bring you some fune ral \n",
      "dumplings,\" and they'd all laugh. Then they'd talk and tell each other  their thoughts. \n",
      "Even though there wasn't anything to eat, the \"tea parties\" we re fun. \n",
      "The \"tea party\" was a wonderful farewell gift that Ryo-cha n left the children. And \n",
      "although none of them had the faintest idea then, it was in fact the last game they \n",
      "were to play at Tomoe before the children parted and went their sepa rate ways. \n",
      "Ryo-chan went off on the Toyoko train. His departure coincided with the  arrival of \n",
      "the American airplanes. They finally appeared in the skies above Tokyo and began \n",
      "dropping bombs every day. \n",
      "Sayonara, Sayonara!  \n",
      "Tomoe burned down. It happened at night. Miyo-chan, her sister Misa-cha n, and \n",

      "the sounds he loved so much of children laughing and children singing, the school \n",
      "was collapsing with a fearful noise. The fire, impossible to que nch, burned it down to \n",
      "the ground. Fires blared up all over Jiyugaoka. \n",
      "In the midst of it all, the headmaster stood in the road and watched Tomoe burn. He \n",

      " 96  POSTSCRIPT \n",
      "To write about the school called Tomoe and Sosaku Kobayashi, the man who \n",
      "founded and ran it are the things I have most wanted to do for a long t ime. \n",
      "I have invented none of the episodes. They are all events that real ly happened and, \n",
      "thankfully, I have been able to remember quite a few of them. Be sides wanting to \n",
      "write them down, I have been anxious to make amends for a broken pledge.  As I \n",
      "have described in one of the chapters, as a child I made a solemn prom ise to Mr. \n",
      "Kobayashi that I would teach at Tomoe when I grew up. However, it was a promise I \n",
      "was not able to fulfill. Instead I have tried to reveal, to a s many people as possible, \n",
      "what sort of man Mr. Kobayashi was, his great love for children, and how he set \n",
      "about educating them. \n",
      "Mr. Kobayashi died in 1963. If he were alive today there would be much more he \n",
      "could have told me. Even as I write I realize how many episodes t hat just seem happy \n",
      "childhood memories to me were, in fact, activities carefully t hought out by him to \n",
      "achieve certain results. \"So that's what Mr. Kobayashi must ha ve had in mind,\" I find \n",
      "myself thinking. Or, \"Fancy him even thinking about that.\" With ea ch discovery I \n",
      "make, I am amazed-and deeply moved and grateful. \n",
      "In my own case, I find it impossible to assess how much I have be en sustained by the \n",
      "way he used to keep saying to me, \"You're really a good girl, you know.\" Had I not \n",
      "entered Tomoe and had I never met Mr. Kobayashi, I would probably have  been \n",
      "labeled \"a bad girl,\" becoming complex-ridden and confused. \n",
      "Tomoe was destroyed by fire in the Tokyo air raids in 1945. Mr. Kobayashi had built \n",
      "the school with his own money, so reestablishing it took time. Afte r the war, he \n",
      "started a kindergarten on the old site, while helping to establish wha t is now the \n",
      "Child Education Department of Kunitachi College of Music. He also ta ught \n",
      "eurythmics there and assisted in the establishment of Kunitachi E lementary School. \n",
      "He died, at the age of sixty-nine, before he could set up his idea l school once more. \n",
      "Tomoe Gakuen was in southwest Tokyo, a three-minute walk from Jiyu gaoka Station \n",
      "on the Toyoko Line. The site is now occupied by the Peacock super-ma rket and \n",
      "parking lot. I went there the other day out of sheer nostalgia, al though I knew nothing \n",
      "was left of the school or its grounds. I drove slowly past the par king lot, where the \n",
      "railroad-car classrooms and playground used to be. The man in charge of the packing \n",
      "lot saw my car and called out, \"You can't come in, you can't come in. We're full!\" \n",
      "\"I don't want to park,\" I felt like saying, “I’m just evoking m emories.” But he would \n",
      "not have understood, so I went on. But a great sadness came over me a nd tears rolled \n",
      "down my cheeks as I sped away. \n",
      "I am sure all over the world there are fine educators - people w ith high ideals and a \n",
      "great love for children--who dream of setting up ideal schools. And I know how \n",
      "difficult it must be to realize this dream. It took Mr. Kobayas hi years and years of \n",
      "study before starting Tomoe in 1937 and it burned down in 1945, so its exist ence was \n",
      "very brief. \n",
      " 97  I like to believe that the period I was there when Mr. Kobaya shi's enthusiasm was at \n",
      "its height and his schemes in full flower. But when I think how man y children could \n",
      "have-come under his care had there been no war, I am saddened at the waste. \n",
      "I have tried to describe Mr. Kobayashi's educational methods in this book. He \n",
      "believed all children are born with an innate good nature, which can be easily \n",
      "damaged by their environment and the wrong adult influences. His a im was to \n",
      "uncover their \"good nature\" and develop it, so that the children would gro w into \n",
      "people with individuality. \n",
      "Mr. Kobayashi valued naturalness and wanted to let children's char acters develop as \n",
      "naturally as possible. He loved nature, too. His younger daughter, Mi yo-chan, told \n",
      "me her father used to take her for walks when she was small,  saying, “Let's go and \n",
      "look for the rhythms in nature.\" \n",
      "He would lead her to a large tree and show her how the leaves and branches swayed \n",
      "in the breeze; he would point out the relationship between the leaves, the branches, \n",
      "and the trunk; and how the swaying of the leaves differed according t o whether the \n",
      "wind was strong or weak. They would stand still and observe things like that, and if \n",
      "there was no  wind, they would wait patiently, with upturned faces, for the slightest \n",
      "zephyr. They observed not only the wind, but rivers, too. They used t o go to the \n",
